We have never quite managed to generate critical mass here, and it's very quiet now. It takes a lot of @Watergypsy's time to maintain the server, has a carbon cost, and despite very generous donations from the community, we aren't covering the financial cost. Our view is that we should bring it to a graceful end.",
