Tell Harold he needs to clean out his USB C ports because they've got compacted dirt, dust, and just general crud in the very back of the port. If you do a lot of physical labor outside or in dusty and dirty environments like myself, I have to clean them out every 12 to 18 months or my cable won't seat entirely or only partially and will keep disconnecting or fail to charge at all. Compressed air or gentle cleaning won't work, he needs a hard metal tool that can scrape almost as hard as a dental pick, trust me.First time this happened to me on my OnePlus 8 phone I was forced to use only the wireless charging over night until I couldn't anymore. I tried blowing it out and cleaning it gently, but it wasn't working. Didn't want to replace an otherwise perfectly good phone so I took it to a local repair shop in desperation. The repair tech took it back and came out two minutes later to ask me if I was blue collar because the port was just crammed with compacted dirt. He gave it back to me cleaned and working, free of charge. I assume you lot work in relatively clean environments and just don't run into this issue as quickly or at all.",

If you do a lot of physical labor outside or in dusty and dirty environments like myself, I have to clean them out every 12 to 18 months or my cable won't seat entirely or only partially and will keep disconnecting or fail to charge at all. Compressed air or gentle cleaning won't work, he needs a hard metal tool that can scrape almost as hard as a dental pick, trust me.First time this happened to me on my OnePlus 8 phone I was forced to use only the wireless charging over night until I couldn't anymore. I tried blowing it out and cleaning it gently, but it wasn't working. Didn't want to replace an otherwise perfectly good phone so I took it to a local repair shop in desperation. The repair tech took it back and came out two minutes later to ask me if I was blue collar because the port was just crammed with compacted dirt. He gave it back to me cleaned and working, free of charge. I assume you lot work in relatively clean environments and just don't run into this issue as quickly or at all.",

If you do a lot of physical labor outside or in dusty and dirty environments like myself, I have to clean them out every 12 to 18 months or my cable won't seat entirely or only partially and will keep disconnecting or fail to charge at all. Compressed air or gentle cleaning won't work, he needs a hard metal tool that can scrape almost as hard as a dental pick, trust me.First time this happened to me on my OnePlus 8 phone I was forced to use only the wireless charging over night until I couldn't anymore. I tried blowing it out and cleaning it gently, but it wasn't working. Didn't want to replace an otherwise perfectly good phone so I took it to a local repair shop in desperation. The repair tech took it back and came out two minutes later to ask me if I was blue collar because the port was just crammed with compacted dirt. He gave it back to me cleaned and working, free of charge. I assume you lot work in relatively clean environments and just don't run into this issue as quickly or at all.",

If you do a lot of physical labor outside or in dusty and dirty environments like myself, I have to clean them out every 12 to 18 months or my cable won't seat entirely or only partially and will keep disconnecting or fail to charge at all. Compressed air or gentle cleaning won't work, he needs a hard metal tool that can scrape almost as hard as a dental pick, trust me.First time this happened to me on my OnePlus 8 phone I was forced to use only the wireless charging over night until I couldn't anymore. I tried blowing it out and cleaning it gently, but it wasn't working. Didn't want to replace an otherwise perfectly good phone so I took it to a local repair shop in desperation. The repair tech took it back and came out two minutes later to ask me if I was blue collar because the port was just crammed with compacted dirt. He gave it back to me cleaned and working, free of charge. I assume you lot work in relatively clean environments and just don't run into this issue as quickly or at all.",

If you do a lot of physical labor outside or in dusty and dirty environments like myself, I have to clean them out every 12 to 18 months or my cable won't seat entirely or only partially and will keep disconnecting or fail to charge at all. Compressed air or gentle cleaning won't work, he needs a hard metal tool that can scrape almost as hard as a dental pick, trust me.First time this happened to me on my OnePlus 8 phone I was forced to use only the wireless charging over night until I couldn't anymore. I tried blowing it out and cleaning it gently, but it wasn't working. Didn't want to replace an otherwise perfectly good phone so I took it to a local repair shop in desperation. The repair tech took it back and came out two minutes later to ask me if I was blue collar because the port was just crammed with compacted dirt. He gave it back to me cleaned and working, free of charge. I assume you lot work in relatively clean environments and just don't run into this issue as quickly or at all.",

If you do a lot of physical labor outside or in dusty and dirty environments like myself, I have to clean them out every 12 to 18 months or my cable won't seat entirely or only partially and will keep disconnecting or fail to charge at all. Compressed air or gentle cleaning won't work, he needs a hard metal tool that can scrape almost as hard as a dental pick, trust me.First time this happened to me on my OnePlus 8 phone I was forced to use only the wireless charging over night until I couldn't anymore. I tried blowing it out and cleaning it gently, but it wasn't working. Didn't want to replace an otherwise perfectly good phone so I took it to a local repair shop in desperation. The repair tech took it back and came out two minutes later to ask me if I was blue collar because the port was just crammed with compacted dirt. He gave it back to me cleaned and working, free of charge. I assume you lot work in relatively clean environments and just don't run into this issue as quickly or at all.",

Tell Harold he needs to clean out his USB C ports because they've got compacted dirt, dust, and just general crud in the very back of the port. If you do a lot of physical labor outside or in dusty and dirty environments like myself, I have to clean them out every 12 to 18 months or my cable won't seat entirely or only partially and will keep disconnecting or fail to charge at all. Compressed air or gentle cleaning won't work, he needs a hard metal tool that can scrape almost as hard as a dental pick, trust me.First time this happened to me on my OnePlus 8 phone I was forced to use only the wireless charging over night until I couldn't anymore. I tried blowing it out and cleaning it gently, but it wasn't working. Didn't want to replace an otherwise perfectly good phone so I took it to a local repair shop in desperation. The repair tech took it back and came out two minutes later to ask me if I was blue collar because the port was just crammed with compacted dirt. He gave it back to me cleaned and working, free of charge. I assume you lot work in relatively clean environments and just don't run into this issue as quickly or at all.",
