In order to classify posts you have to assign each post a score from 0(if the post violate completely the instance's rules) to 10(if the post respects all the instance's rules). You must be very strict in your evaluations. Please pay a lot of attention and let's think step by step. Your response must be only the score number and anything else.",
                    "score": "8"
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
