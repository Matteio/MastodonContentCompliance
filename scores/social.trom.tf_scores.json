Maybe a year I don't remember...I have other 3 books in the works for the past 2 or so years and am wondering if I am still able to pull this off....I wanted to start a video series, and perhaps I still want to do that.

Like this book about Language is for me lifechanging in regards to this subject, I changed the way I see \"language\" forever while writing it. And hopefully would have the same impact on those reading it. But if I were to make a video about it....that would be a massive course, not a video. And would require a lot of \"performing\" and video editing. Presenting, recording, video editing...insanity.So yah am wondering how to \"move forward\"....write books? Try making videos?Currently I am writing about culture. A book/video titled \"Culture Cancer\".

And how important this book is.I don't know if I can outdo my past self in terms of sheer amount of work put into these books...I am scared to look at them and realize how much effort was put into writing, sourcing, proofreading, and designing.It took us around half a year or more to finish this book. Maybe a year I don't remember...I have other 3 books in the works for the past 2 or so years and am wondering if I am still able to pull this off....I wanted to start a video series, and perhaps I still want to do that. But writing books feels more natural to me and the end result is much more important in my view. Like this book about Language is for me lifechanging in regards to this subject, I changed the way I see \"language\" forever while writing it. And hopefully would have the same impact on those reading it. But if I were to make a video about it....that would be a massive course, not a video. And would require a lot of \"performing\" and video editing. Presenting, recording, video editing...insanity.So yah am wondering how to \"move forward\"....write books? Try making videos?Currently I am writing about culture. A book/video titled \"Culture Cancer\". Let's see where it goes....I did not forget that I have started a book about The Internet and one about Human Behavior.I feel good going deep into these topics....keeps me sane and more educated. And I like it.What I don't like, of course, is the fact that I don't find a place for me in this society and I can't really afford to spend many many months, make a great book, then put it for free, and expect to also survive in this bullshit society. That I am struggling with. I've always had. Says all I have to know about how fucked up this society is.But anyway, I have survived while TROMing for the past 14 or so years, I will probably survive a few more years :).#language #culture #society",

And how important this book is.I don't know if I can outdo my past self in terms of sheer amount of work put into these books...I am scared to look at them and realize how much effort was put into writing, sourcing, proofreading, and designing.It took us around half a year or more to finish this book. Maybe a year I don't remember...I have other 3 books in the works for the past 2 or so years and am wondering if I am still able to pull this off....I wanted to start a video series, and perhaps I still want to do that. But writing books feels more natural to me and the end result is much more important in my view. Like this book about Language is for me lifechanging in regards to this subject, I changed the way I see \"language\" forever while writing it. And hopefully would have the same impact on those reading it. But if I were to make a video about it....that would be a massive course, not a video. And would require a lot of \"performing\" and video editing. Presenting, recording, video editing...insanity.So yah am wondering how to \"move forward\"....write books? Try making videos?Currently I am writing about culture. A book/video titled \"Culture Cancer\". Let's see where it goes....I did not forget that I have started a book about The Internet and one about Human Behavior.I feel good going deep into these topics....keeps me sane and more educated. And I like it.What I don't like, of course, is the fact that I don't find a place for me in this society and I can't really afford to spend many many months, make a great book, then put it for free, and expect to also survive in this bullshit society. That I am struggling with. I've always had. Says all I have to know about how fucked up this society is.But anyway, I have survived while TROMing for the past 14 or so years, I will probably survive a few more years :).#language #culture #society",

And how important this book is.I don't know if I can outdo my past self in terms of sheer amount of work put into these books...I am scared to look at them and realize how much effort was put into writing, sourcing, proofreading, and designing.It took us around half a year or more to finish this book. Maybe a year I don't remember...I have other 3 books in the works for the past 2 or so years and am wondering if I am still able to pull this off....I wanted to start a video series, and perhaps I still want to do that. But writing books feels more natural to me and the end result is much more important in my view. Like this book about Language is for me lifechanging in regards to this subject, I changed the way I see \"language\" forever while writing it. And hopefully would have the same impact on those reading it. But if I were to make a video about it....that would be a massive course, not a video. And would require a lot of \"performing\" and video editing. Presenting, recording, video editing...insanity.So yah am wondering how to \"move forward\"....write books? Try making videos?Currently I am writing about culture. A book/video titled \"Culture Cancer\". Let's see where it goes....I did not forget that I have started a book about The Internet and one about Human Behavior.I feel good going deep into these topics....keeps me sane and more educated. And I like it.What I don't like, of course, is the fact that I don't find a place for me in this society and I can't really afford to spend many many months, make a great book, then put it for free, and expect to also survive in this bullshit society. That I am struggling with. I've always had. Says all I have to know about how fucked up this society is.But anyway, I have survived while TROMing for the past 14 or so years, I will probably survive a few more years :).#language #culture #society",
