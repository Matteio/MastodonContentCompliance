However, because of the abundance of staff, the (as a result) short list of tasks and responsibilities we each have, and perhaps the fact that 50% of people here are working in the same office together year round/have done this festival several years in a row, it seems the top thing on everyone's mind is hooking up, dating, or at least entertaining the possibility of one of the two.Coincidentally, 95% of the workforce here are women and the 5% of men around just so happen to be in my department so I'm getting a front row view of the fan clubs each of these extremely ordinary guys are getting and watching the delight of the select women they choose to reciprocate attention towards... nevermind the fact that half these guys already have girlfriends.In the midst of all this, I have been identified ~~somehow~~ as an outlier which puts me in a position of being invisible to the men (which is great until you have to move mountains of gear to get something at the back of a truck) but also the primary receptacle for women to pour their excitement and woes into because I guess I'm not seen as competition.  The oddest thing in this whole equation is that in my conversations with female coworkers, they are either talking about \"getting with\" these men OR about how much they hate men. It depends on the hour of the day. And if I suggest simply refusing to entertain the men in this game everyone has seemingly elected to play, it's like their brain shorts out. Because I guess I've done this too much, yesterday one woman heavily implied to my face that I was autistic because Star Wars is my \"special interest\" and another woman out of NOWHERE decided that out of everyone in the room I would somehow have the most in-depth knowledge about strap-on... dildo... sex accessories?

However, because of the abundance of staff, the (as a result) short list of tasks and responsibilities we each have, and perhaps the fact that 50% of people here are working in the same office together year round/have done this festival several years in a row, it seems the top thing on everyone's mind is hooking up, dating, or at least entertaining the possibility of one of the two.Coincidentally, 95% of the workforce here are women and the 5% of men around just so happen to be in my department so I'm getting a front row view of the fan clubs each of these extremely ordinary guys are getting and watching the delight of the select women they choose to reciprocate attention towards... nevermind the fact that half these guys already have girlfriends.In the midst of all this, I have been identified ~~somehow~~ as an outlier which puts me in a position of being invisible to the men (which is great until you have to move mountains of gear to get something at the back of a truck) but also the primary receptacle for women to pour their excitement and woes into because I guess I'm not seen as competition.  The oddest thing in this whole equation is that in my conversations with female coworkers, they are either talking about \"getting with\" these men OR about how much they hate men. It depends on the hour of the day. And if I suggest simply refusing to entertain the men in this game everyone has seemingly elected to play, it's like their brain shorts out. Because I guess I've done this too much, yesterday one woman heavily implied to my face that I was autistic because Star Wars is my \"special interest\" and another woman out of NOWHERE decided that out of everyone in the room I would somehow have the most in-depth knowledge about strap-on... dildo... sex accessories?

The oddest thing in this whole equation is that in my conversations with female coworkers, they are either talking about \"getting with\" these men OR about how much they hate men. It depends on the hour of the day. And if I suggest simply refusing to entertain the men in this game everyone has seemingly elected to play, it's like their brain shorts out. Because I guess I've done this too much, yesterday one woman heavily implied to my face that I was autistic because Star Wars is my \"special interest\" and another woman out of NOWHERE decided that out of everyone in the room I would somehow have the most in-depth knowledge about strap-on... dildo... sex accessories?

The oddest thing in this whole equation is that in my conversations with female coworkers, they are either talking about \"getting with\" these men OR about how much they hate men. It depends on the hour of the day. And if I suggest simply refusing to entertain the men in this game everyone has seemingly elected to play, it's like their brain shorts out. Because I guess I've done this too much, yesterday one woman heavily implied to my face that I was autistic because Star Wars is my \"special interest\" and another woman out of NOWHERE decided that out of everyone in the room I would somehow have the most in-depth knowledge about strap-on... dildo... sex accessories?

The oddest thing in this whole equation is that in my conversations with female coworkers, they are either talking about \"getting with\" these men OR about how much they hate men. It depends on the hour of the day. And if I suggest simply refusing to entertain the men in this game everyone has seemingly elected to play, it's like their brain shorts out. Because I guess I've done this too much, yesterday one woman heavily implied to my face that I was autistic because Star Wars is my \"special interest\" and another woman out of NOWHERE decided that out of everyone in the room I would somehow have the most in-depth knowledge about strap-on... dildo... sex accessories?

However, because of the abundance of staff, the (as a result) short list of tasks and responsibilities we each have, and perhaps the fact that 50% of people here are working in the same office together year round/have done this festival several years in a row, it seems the top thing on everyone's mind is hooking up, dating, or at least entertaining the possibility of one of the two.Coincidentally, 95% of the workforce here are women and the 5% of men around just so happen to be in my department so I'm getting a front row view of the fan clubs each of these extremely ordinary guys are getting and watching the delight of the select women they choose to reciprocate attention towards... nevermind the fact that half these guys already have girlfriends.In the midst of all this, I have been identified ~~somehow~~ as an outlier which puts me in a position of being invisible to the men (which is great until you have to move mountains of gear to get something at the back of a truck) but also the primary receptacle for women to pour their excitement and woes into because I guess I'm not seen as competition.  The oddest thing in this whole equation is that in my conversations with female coworkers, they are either talking about \"getting with\" these men OR about how much they hate men. It depends on the hour of the day. And if I suggest simply refusing to entertain the men in this game everyone has seemingly elected to play, it's like their brain shorts out. Because I guess I've done this too much, yesterday one woman heavily implied to my face that I was autistic because Star Wars is my \"special interest\" and another woman out of NOWHERE decided that out of everyone in the room I would somehow have the most in-depth knowledge about strap-on... dildo... sex accessories? Idk.",
