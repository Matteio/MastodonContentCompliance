This either means there's invisible (\"dark\") matter in them keeping them together, or we don't understand gravity.  To reproduce galaxy rotation, the former requires that they sit in a big ~spherical halo of dark matter.  Go far enough out, the halo vanishes, and rotation speeds go down.This paper estimated rotation speeds using gravitational lensing.  Spacetime bends near massive objects, and this distorts how objects look when their light passes through that bend.  The more massive, the more distortion, so you can measure the distortion to estimate the mass, and from there estimate how fast things should move at different distances from the galaxy.They found that if mass is estimated in this way, the rotation speed never seems to decline like it should if halos were a thing.  That's very hard to reconcile with the dark matter model.#astronomy",

This either means there's invisible (\"dark\") matter in them keeping them together, or we don't understand gravity.  To reproduce galaxy rotation, the former requires that they sit in a big ~spherical halo of dark matter.  Go far enough out, the halo vanishes, and rotation speeds go down.This paper estimated rotation speeds using gravitational lensing.  Spacetime bends near massive objects, and this distorts how objects look when their light passes through that bend.  The more massive, the more distortion, so you can measure the distortion to estimate the mass, and from there estimate how fast things should move at different distances from the galaxy.They found that if mass is estimated in this way, the rotation speed never seems to decline like it should if halos were a thing.  That's very hard to reconcile with the dark matter model.#astronomy",

This either means there's invisible (\"dark\") matter in them keeping them together, or we don't understand gravity.  To reproduce galaxy rotation, the former requires that they sit in a big ~spherical halo of dark matter.  Go far enough out, the halo vanishes, and rotation speeds go down.This paper estimated rotation speeds using gravitational lensing.  Spacetime bends near massive objects, and this distorts how objects look when their light passes through that bend.  The more massive, the more distortion, so you can measure the distortion to estimate the mass, and from there estimate how fast things should move at different distances from the galaxy.They found that if mass is estimated in this way, the rotation speed never seems to decline like it should if halos were a thing.  That's very hard to reconcile with the dark matter model.#astronomy",

This either means there's invisible (\"dark\") matter in them keeping them together, or we don't understand gravity.  To reproduce galaxy rotation, the former requires that they sit in a big ~spherical halo of dark matter.  Go far enough out, the halo vanishes, and rotation speeds go down.This paper estimated rotation speeds using gravitational lensing.  Spacetime bends near massive objects, and this distorts how objects look when their light passes through that bend.  The more massive, the more distortion, so you can measure the distortion to estimate the mass, and from there estimate how fast things should move at different distances from the galaxy.They found that if mass is estimated in this way, the rotation speed never seems to decline like it should if halos were a thing.  That's very hard to reconcile with the dark matter model.#astronomy",
