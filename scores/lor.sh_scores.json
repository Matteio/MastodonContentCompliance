The pair also wrote together under the #PenName Lewis Padgett (their mothers' maiden names).So this particular #novel claims to be #written by CL Moore and Henry Kuttner and CL Moore. Did Moore do twice the work? The ISFDb page is also odd. 1949 serialization by Henry Kuttner alone, under the Portal name. 1954 novel printing, same name, Kuttner. But also a 1954 printing as _Beyond Earth's Gates_ by Moore and Padgett. And a 2012 reprint by Moore alone, under the Beyond title.
