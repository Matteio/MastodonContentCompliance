Chief of Police Ernst P\u00f6hner and Wilhelm Frick openly indulged in antisemitism, while Bavarian judges praised people on the political right as patriotic for their crimes and handed down mild sentences.In 1923. 1923. That is 20 years before 1943. I mean I know of course that antisemitism existed already. It's just so fucking painful to see we're doing the exact same thing. In 2014 Wilders went \"do you want more or less Moroccans?\" and the crowd chanted \"less! less! less!\" Ten years later, in 2023, his party won the elections. And that's just one event in one country. What the fuck what the fuck what the fuck",

That is 20 years before 1943. I mean I know of course that antisemitism existed already. It's just so fucking painful to see we're doing the exact same thing. In 2014 Wilders went \"do you want more or less Moroccans?\" and the crowd chanted \"less! less! less!\" Ten years later, in 2023, his party won the elections.

That is 20 years before 1943. I mean I know of course that antisemitism existed already. It's just so fucking painful to see we're doing the exact same thing. In 2014 Wilders went \"do you want more or less Moroccans?\" and the crowd chanted \"less! less! less!\" Ten years later, in 2023, his party won the elections.

Chief of Police Ernst P\u00f6hner and Wilhelm Frick openly indulged in antisemitism, while Bavarian judges praised people on the political right as patriotic for their crimes and handed down mild sentences.In 1923. 1923. That is 20 years before 1943. I mean I know of course that antisemitism existed already. It's just so fucking painful to see we're doing the exact same thing. In 2014 Wilders went \"do you want more or less Moroccans?\" and the crowd chanted \"less! less! less!\" Ten years later, in 2023, his party won the elections. And that's just one event in one country. What the fuck what the fuck what the fuck",
