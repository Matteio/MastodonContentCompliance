The best I can determine after about 12 hours of tinkering is that the UV overlaps. Which isn't really visible in Blinn-phong. PBR wants that missing uv piece, and upon finding it is blank, just gives up and falls back on Blinn Phong. The problem? The mesh also overlaps, unevenly. So I can't just treat it face by face, because the bits with the missing UV poke through in the back of the garment. Unfortunately it was a full perm promo item from a very famous SL store.  Complaining is like pissing in a hurricane for that sort of place. I kind of want my money back but I'm sure they'll say it was experimental blahblah.

The best I can determine after about 12 hours of tinkering is that the UV overlaps. Which isn't really visible in Blinn-phong. PBR wants that missing uv piece, and upon finding it is blank, just gives up and falls back on Blinn Phong. The problem? The mesh also overlaps, unevenly. So I can't just treat it face by face, because the bits with the missing UV poke through in the back of the garment. Unfortunately it was a full perm promo item from a very famous SL store.  Complaining is like pissing in a hurricane for that sort of place. I kind of want my money back but I'm sure they'll say it was experimental blahblah. Additional problem: I still actually want it, and there's not anything else like it full perm right now. But the thing doesn't *work* right, and I don't think it's actually a fixable problem.",

PBR wants that missing uv piece, and upon finding it is blank, just gives up and falls back on Blinn Phong. The problem? The mesh also overlaps, unevenly. So I can't just treat it face by face, because the bits with the missing UV poke through in the back of the garment. Unfortunately it was a full perm promo item from a very famous SL store.  Complaining is like pissing in a hurricane for that sort of place. I kind of want my money back but I'm sure they'll say it was experimental blahblah.

PBR wants that missing uv piece, and upon finding it is blank, just gives up and falls back on Blinn Phong. The problem? The mesh also overlaps, unevenly. So I can't just treat it face by face, because the bits with the missing UV poke through in the back of the garment. Unfortunately it was a full perm promo item from a very famous SL store.  Complaining is like pissing in a hurricane for that sort of place. I kind of want my money back but I'm sure they'll say it was experimental blahblah.

The best I can determine after about 12 hours of tinkering is that the UV overlaps. Which isn't really visible in Blinn-phong. PBR wants that missing uv piece, and upon finding it is blank, just gives up and falls back on Blinn Phong. The problem? The mesh also overlaps, unevenly. So I can't just treat it face by face, because the bits with the missing UV poke through in the back of the garment. Unfortunately it was a full perm promo item from a very famous SL store.  Complaining is like pissing in a hurricane for that sort of place. I kind of want my money back but I'm sure they'll say it was experimental blahblah.

The best I can determine after about 12 hours of tinkering is that the UV overlaps. Which isn't really visible in Blinn-phong. PBR wants that missing uv piece, and upon finding it is blank, just gives up and falls back on Blinn Phong. The problem? The mesh also overlaps, unevenly. So I can't just treat it face by face, because the bits with the missing UV poke through in the back of the garment. Unfortunately it was a full perm promo item from a very famous SL store.  Complaining is like pissing in a hurricane for that sort of place. I kind of want my money back but I'm sure they'll say it was experimental blahblah. Additional problem: I still actually want it, and there's not anything else like it full perm right now. But the thing doesn't *work* right, and I don't think it's actually a fixable problem.",
