Whilst I think the canvas piece (third picture) came out fairly well, I think the two I did on a legal graffiti wall near me could have come out a little better. I'll chalk it up as a learning experience though and grow from it - using spray paint as well as making, cutting out and transporting stencils is all very new to me. If anyone is interested in hearing more about the thought process and the makings of this piece, let me know - it might be cool to write a blog post about it. For now, happy pride month, all \ud83d\udc99 I'll have something else to share soon of a similar nature. #art#furryart#pride#pridemonth",
