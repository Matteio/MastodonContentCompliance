Security Intelligence Cener (ASEC) the malware is commonly spread through phishing emails and contains a compressed file (TA0001 - Initial Access, T1566.001 - Phishing: Spearphishing Attachment). Contained within this compressed file exists the scripting file that will ultimately lead to the HappyDoor malware. Multiple living-off-the-land binaries are abused here which include PowerShell (TA0002 - Execution, T1059.001 - Command and Scripting Interpreter: PowerShell), Windows Command Shell (T1059.003 - Command and Scripting Interpreter: Windows Command Shell), Regsrv32.exe (TA0005 - Defense Evasion, T1218.010 - System Binary Proxy Execution: RegSvr32) just to name a few.

Security Intelligence Cener (ASEC) the malware is commonly spread through phishing emails and contains a compressed file (TA0001 - Initial Access, T1566.001 - Phishing: Spearphishing Attachment). Contained within this compressed file exists the scripting file that will ultimately lead to the HappyDoor malware. Multiple living-off-the-land binaries are abused here which include PowerShell (TA0002 - Execution, T1059.001 - Command and Scripting Interpreter: PowerShell), Windows Command Shell (T1059.003 - Command and Scripting Interpreter: Windows Command Shell), Regsrv32.exe (TA0005 - Defense Evasion, T1218.010 - System Binary Proxy Execution: RegSvr32) just to name a few.

Security Intelligence Cener (ASEC) the malware is commonly spread through phishing emails and contains a compressed file (TA0001 - Initial Access, T1566.001 - Phishing: Spearphishing Attachment). Contained within this compressed file exists the scripting file that will ultimately lead to the HappyDoor malware. Multiple living-off-the-land binaries are abused here which include PowerShell (TA0002 - Execution, T1059.001 - Command and Scripting Interpreter: PowerShell), Windows Command Shell (T1059.003 - Command and Scripting Interpreter: Windows Command Shell), Regsrv32.exe (TA0005 - Defense Evasion, T1218.010 - System Binary Proxy Execution: RegSvr32) just to name a few.

Security Intelligence Cener (ASEC) the malware is commonly spread through phishing emails and contains a compressed file (TA0001 - Initial Access, T1566.001 - Phishing: Spearphishing Attachment).

Security Intelligence Cener (ASEC) the malware is commonly spread through phishing emails and contains a compressed file (TA0001 - Initial Access, T1566.001 - Phishing: Spearphishing Attachment). Contained within this compressed file exists the scripting file that will ultimately lead to the HappyDoor malware. Multiple living-off-the-land binaries are abused here which include PowerShell (TA0002 - Execution, T1059.001 - Command and Scripting Interpreter: PowerShell), Windows Command Shell (T1059.003 - Command and Scripting Interpreter: Windows Command Shell), Regsrv32.exe (TA0005 - Defense Evasion, T1218.010 - System Binary Proxy Execution: RegSvr32) just to name a few.

Security Intelligence Cener (ASEC) the malware is commonly spread through phishing emails and contains a compressed file (TA0001 - Initial Access, T1566.001 - Phishing: Spearphishing Attachment). Contained within this compressed file exists the scripting file that will ultimately lead to the HappyDoor malware. Multiple living-off-the-land binaries are abused here which include PowerShell (TA0002 - Execution, T1059.001 - Command and Scripting Interpreter: PowerShell), Windows Command Shell (T1059.003 - Command and Scripting Interpreter: Windows Command Shell), Regsrv32.exe (TA0005 - Defense Evasion, T1218.010 - System Binary Proxy Execution: RegSvr32) just to name a few.
