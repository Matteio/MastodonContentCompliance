The right-wing Avlon buried centrist physics professor Nancy Goroff 19,026 (70.3%) to 8,053 (29.7%). The entire rotting New York political establishment endorsed Avlon. I asked one of his endorsers why he had endorsed a Republican who had been Giuliani\u2019s long-time speech-writer. He said he didn\u2019t know Avlon beyond the fact that he was a CNN contributor, was unaware on his Giuliani connection but felt Goroff was too physically unattractive to win against Nick LaLota, who no one would ever describe as \u201chandsome.\u201d LaLota, is almost certain to beat Avlon, who will be unable to motivate progressive voters in November.

Kingfisher's THORNHEDGE is another Sleeping Beauty revision that takes a different angle: our POV character is Toadling, the fairy who now lives in the forest surrounding the castle and spends a lot of her time in toad form.  She watches passers-by with suspicion, hoping they don't notice the castle hidden behind the hedges... then after a few centuries a knight arrives in search of the lost castle. The story's approach is reminiscent of Gaiman's story \"Snow, Glass, Apples\", but brighter and in the end it's a sweet-hearted story, another great one from Kingfisher.#Thornhedge #TKingfisher #SleepingBeauty #NeilGaiman #SnowGlassApples",

In this one, the story-gathering monk Chih has returned home to the Singing Hills abbey, to rest and to visit their former travelling buddy, the intelligent bird Almost Brilliant. Almost Brilliant has been busy hatching an egg and raising the chick.  But things are different at the abbey: beloved abbott Cleric Thien has died, the abbott's companion bird Myriad Virtues is grieving and turns up mutilated, and there are two war mammoths lurking at the gate, brought by Thien's former family who want to carry away his body.It's an engaging story with an ending that I found puzzling: I don't understandthe implications that it has for the world of the series.#MammothsAtTheGates #NghiVo",

The right-wing Avlon buried centrist physics professor Nancy Goroff 19,026 (70.3%) to 8,053 (29.7%). The entire rotting New York political establishment endorsed Avlon. I asked one of his endorsers why he had endorsed a Republican who had been Giuliani\u2019s long-time speech-writer. He said he didn\u2019t know Avlon beyond the fact that he was a CNN contributor, was unaware on his Giuliani connection but felt Goroff was too physically unattractive to win against Nick LaLota, who no one would ever describe as \u201chandsome.\u201d LaLota, is almost certain to beat Avlon, who will be unable to motivate progressive voters in November.

She watches passers-by with suspicion, hoping they don't notice the castle hidden behind the hedges... then after a few centuries a knight arrives in search of the lost castle. The story's approach is reminiscent of Gaiman's story \"Snow, Glass, Apples\", but brighter and in the end it's a sweet-hearted story, another great one from Kingfisher.#Thornhedge #TKingfisher #SleepingBeauty #NeilGaiman #SnowGlassApples",

Almost Brilliant has been busy hatching an egg and raising the chick.

The right-wing Avlon buried centrist physics professor Nancy Goroff 19,026 (70.3%) to 8,053 (29.7%). The entire rotting New York political establishment endorsed Avlon. I asked one of his endorsers why he had endorsed a Republican who had been Giuliani\u2019s long-time speech-writer. He said he didn\u2019t know Avlon beyond the fact that he was a CNN contributor, was unaware on his Giuliani connection but felt Goroff was too physically unattractive to win against Nick LaLota, who no one would ever describe as \u201chandsome.\u201d LaLota, is almost certain to beat Avlon, who will be unable to motivate progressive voters in November.

She watches passers-by with suspicion, hoping they don't notice the castle hidden behind the hedges... then after a few centuries a knight arrives in search of the lost castle. The story's approach is reminiscent of Gaiman's story \"Snow, Glass, Apples\", but brighter and in the end it's a sweet-hearted story, another great one from Kingfisher.#Thornhedge #TKingfisher #SleepingBeauty #NeilGaiman #SnowGlassApples",

Almost Brilliant has been busy hatching an egg and raising the chick.

The right-wing Avlon buried centrist physics professor Nancy Goroff 19,026 (70.3%) to 8,053 (29.7%). The entire rotting New York political establishment endorsed Avlon. I asked one of his endorsers why he had endorsed a Republican who had been Giuliani\u2019s long-time speech-writer. He said he didn\u2019t know Avlon beyond the fact that he was a CNN contributor, was unaware on his Giuliani connection but felt Goroff was too physically unattractive to win against Nick LaLota, who no one would ever describe as \u201chandsome.\u201d LaLota, is almost certain to beat Avlon, who will be unable to motivate progressive voters in November.

She watches passers-by with suspicion, hoping they don't notice the castle hidden behind the hedges... then after a few centuries a knight arrives in search of the lost castle. The story's approach is reminiscent of Gaiman's story \"Snow, Glass, Apples\", but brighter and in the end it's a sweet-hearted story, another great one from Kingfisher.#Thornhedge #TKingfisher #SleepingBeauty #NeilGaiman #SnowGlassApples",

I asked one of his endorsers why he had endorsed a Republican who had been Giuliani\u2019s long-time speech-writer. He said he didn\u2019t know Avlon beyond the fact that he was a CNN contributor, was unaware on his Giuliani connection but felt Goroff was too physically unattractive to win against Nick LaLota, who no one would ever describe as \u201chandsome.\u201d LaLota, is almost certain to beat Avlon, who will be unable to motivate progressive voters in November.
