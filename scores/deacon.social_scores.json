Other vivid details include her blond eyelashes, her black opera binoculars, a bell pull that deviates tantalizingly from the vertical mirror frame and, reflected in the mirror, a tortoiseshell hair comb.Against this, the pure symmetry of her face betokens celestial harmonies, while her figure is improbably - dreamily \u2014 sinuous. Ingres's anatomical sleights of hand are often remarked on: He places de Broglie's right arm, for instance, at such an angle that it couldn't possibly connect with her unseen shoulder. Likewise, the finger reflected in the mirror shouldn't be visible.\" \u2014 By Sebastian Smee, June 2, 2021",

I did find it on the website for the Pandolfini Casa d'Aste auction house in Florence, a listing from 2015. #arthistory Mirrors can have different meanings depending on context. The woman gazing in the hand mirror could symbolize Vanity. But in this painting, notice the woman has the face of an old man as the back of her head. Prudence can mean forethought, careful planning, reflecting on decisions before rushing in. The old man could symbolize wisdom based on experience. And the snake held in her left hand? \u201cBe wise as serpents,\u201d Jesus said. The book of Genesis refers to the serpent as \u201ccrafty.\u201d Layers of meaning.",

Other vivid details include her blond eyelashes, her black opera binoculars, a bell pull that deviates tantalizingly from the vertical mirror frame and, reflected in the mirror, a tortoiseshell hair comb.Against this, the pure symmetry of her face betokens celestial harmonies, while her figure is improbably - dreamily \u2014 sinuous. Ingres's anatomical sleights of hand are often remarked on: He places de Broglie's right arm, for instance, at such an angle that it couldn't possibly connect with her unseen shoulder. Likewise, the finger reflected in the mirror shouldn't be visible.\" \u2014 By Sebastian Smee, June 2, 2021",

The woman gazing in the hand mirror could symbolize Vanity. But in this painting, notice the woman has the face of an old man as the back of her head. Prudence can mean forethought, careful planning, reflecting on decisions before rushing in. The old man could symbolize wisdom based on experience.

Other vivid details include her blond eyelashes, her black opera binoculars, a bell pull that deviates tantalizingly from the vertical mirror frame and, reflected in the mirror, a tortoiseshell hair comb.Against this, the pure symmetry of her face betokens celestial harmonies, while her figure is improbably - dreamily \u2014 sinuous. Ingres's anatomical sleights of hand are often remarked on: He places de Broglie's right arm, for instance, at such an angle that it couldn't possibly connect with her unseen shoulder. Likewise, the finger reflected in the mirror shouldn't be visible.\" \u2014 By Sebastian Smee, June 2, 2021",

The woman gazing in the hand mirror could symbolize Vanity. But in this painting, notice the woman has the face of an old man as the back of her head. Prudence can mean forethought, careful planning, reflecting on decisions before rushing in. The old man could symbolize wisdom based on experience.

Other vivid details include her blond eyelashes, her black opera binoculars, a bell pull that deviates tantalizingly from the vertical mirror frame and, reflected in the mirror, a tortoiseshell hair comb.Against this, the pure symmetry of her face betokens celestial harmonies, while her figure is improbably - dreamily \u2014 sinuous. Ingres's anatomical sleights of hand are often remarked on: He places de Broglie's right arm, for instance, at such an angle that it couldn't possibly connect with her unseen shoulder. Likewise, the finger reflected in the mirror shouldn't be visible.\" \u2014 By Sebastian Smee, June 2, 2021",

(15.9 x 19.1 cm), Brooklyn Museum, Brooklyn, New York. #arthistoryFrom the museum: \u201cIllustrating the experimental quality and eclecticism of later Qajar art, this mirror case displays bird-and-flower imagery on the front and back surfaces and a hybrid design of figures in European dress of various historical periods on the inner surface. The eight figures in the composition inside are grouped together without scale or thematic connection against a background of lakes and waterfalls. The extensive use of modeling in the treatment of the garments of the figures as well as in the bird-and-flower design on the front surface contributes to the European flavor of this work.\u201d",

The woman gazing in the hand mirror could symbolize Vanity. But in this painting, notice the woman has the face of an old man as the back of her head. Prudence can mean forethought, careful planning, reflecting on decisions before rushing in. The old man could symbolize wisdom based on experience.

Other vivid details include her blond eyelashes, her black opera binoculars, a bell pull that deviates tantalizingly from the vertical mirror frame and, reflected in the mirror, a tortoiseshell hair comb.Against this, the pure symmetry of her face betokens celestial harmonies, while her figure is improbably - dreamily \u2014 sinuous. Ingres's anatomical sleights of hand are often remarked on: He places de Broglie's right arm, for instance, at such an angle that it couldn't possibly connect with her unseen shoulder. Likewise, the finger reflected in the mirror shouldn't be visible.\" \u2014 By Sebastian Smee, June 2, 2021",

The eight figures in the composition inside are grouped together without scale or thematic connection against a background of lakes and waterfalls. The extensive use of modeling in the treatment of the garments of the figures as well as in the bird-and-flower design on the front surface contributes to the European flavor of this work.\u201d",

The woman gazing in the hand mirror could symbolize Vanity. But in this painting, notice the woman has the face of an old man as the back of her head. Prudence can mean forethought, careful planning, reflecting on decisions before rushing in. The old man could symbolize wisdom based on experience.

Other vivid details include her blond eyelashes, her black opera binoculars, a bell pull that deviates tantalizingly from the vertical mirror frame and, reflected in the mirror, a tortoiseshell hair comb.Against this, the pure symmetry of her face betokens celestial harmonies, while her figure is improbably - dreamily \u2014 sinuous. Ingres's anatomical sleights of hand are often remarked on: He places de Broglie's right arm, for instance, at such an angle that it couldn't possibly connect with her unseen shoulder. Likewise, the finger reflected in the mirror shouldn't be visible.\" \u2014 By Sebastian Smee, June 2, 2021",

The eight figures in the composition inside are grouped together without scale or thematic connection against a background of lakes and waterfalls. The extensive use of modeling in the treatment of the garments of the figures as well as in the bird-and-flower design on the front surface contributes to the European flavor of this work.\u201d",

The woman gazing in the hand mirror could symbolize Vanity. But in this painting, notice the woman has the face of an old man as the back of her head. Prudence can mean forethought, careful planning, reflecting on decisions before rushing in. The old man could symbolize wisdom based on experience.

Other vivid details include her blond eyelashes, her black opera binoculars, a bell pull that deviates tantalizingly from the vertical mirror frame and, reflected in the mirror, a tortoiseshell hair comb.Against this, the pure symmetry of her face betokens celestial harmonies, while her figure is improbably - dreamily \u2014 sinuous. Ingres's anatomical sleights of hand are often remarked on: He places de Broglie's right arm, for instance, at such an angle that it couldn't possibly connect with her unseen shoulder. Likewise, the finger reflected in the mirror shouldn't be visible.\" \u2014 By Sebastian Smee, June 2, 2021",

The eight figures in the composition inside are grouped together without scale or thematic connection against a background of lakes and waterfalls. The extensive use of modeling in the treatment of the garments of the figures as well as in the bird-and-flower design on the front surface contributes to the European flavor of this work.\u201d",

The woman, by the way, is not pregnant. Fashionable ladies of the time held up their gown in front of them. #arthistory #art From the website: \u201cThis must be one of the most famous paintings in the world, and one of the most intriguing. A richly dressed man and woman stand in a private room. Although it looks as if Jan van Eyck painted a real room exactly has he saw it, every object has been carefully chosen to proclaim the couple\u2019s wealth and social status without risking criticism for aping the aristocracy\u2026 A large round mirror hangs right in the centre of the composition, its convex glass showing not just the compressed and contorted room but also two men coming in through a door behind us\u2026 the room itself if not a literal record of the couple\u2019s home. Although it looks as if van Eyck has simply removed a wall, close examination reveals inconsistencies. The chandelier cannot fit into the space it seems to occupy; there is no sign of a fireplace; the bed is too short and the ornate convex mirror on the back wall seems impossibly large. As usual, van Eyck created a perfectly convincing show of reality but altered things to fit his aesthetic purposes and perhaps also to accord with Arnolfini\u2019s aspirations\u2026 For a painting that seems so precise, it was surprisingly quickly and freely painted. Van Eyck was almost bouncing the paintbrush off the panel to get small touches of colour, and he used his fingers and the brush handles as well as the points of the brushes. We can see his thumbprint by the shadow of the dog\u2019s leg, and the bristles of the brush hanging by the bed are scratched into the paint.\u201d",
