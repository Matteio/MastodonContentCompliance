I like videogames a lot but most if not all gaming stuff I have seen on Flatpak, Steam and Retroarch included, don't pick up my audio setup. Flatpak seems hard-coded to require the crap called \"Pulseaudio\", and ignores my legit #ALSA setup, which partly exists due to a hardware bug in my machine's motherboard that only ALSA and maybe #Pipewire check for that I know.I can't change the motherboard's audio chip's microtransistors. I *can*, however, use AppImage instead of Flatpak because ALSA Just Works.I trust and hope Pipewire won't cause me such issues once I eventually migrate to a newer machine. Or I can keep ALSA.

I like videogames a lot but most if not all gaming stuff I have seen on Flatpak, Steam and Retroarch included, don't pick up my audio setup. Flatpak seems hard-coded to require the crap called \"Pulseaudio\", and ignores my legit #ALSA setup, which partly exists due to a hardware bug in my machine's motherboard that only ALSA and maybe #Pipewire check for that I know.I can't change the motherboard's audio chip's microtransistors. I *can*, however, use AppImage instead of Flatpak because ALSA Just Works.I trust and hope Pipewire won't cause me such issues once I eventually migrate to a newer machine. Or I can keep ALSA.
