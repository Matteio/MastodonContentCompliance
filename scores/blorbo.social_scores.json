And I have never seen a debate, not national, not state, not local, not middle school, that was that pathetic.That sounds like hyperbole. It is not. Donald Trump was nearly as bad as he has ever been, scatterbrained, unable to hold on to a thread of thought, lying very obviously and poorly, and yet Biden was so much worse that, relying purely on style and technique and not truth, Trump didn't just win he routed.Again, not hyperbole.So here's what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna finish my scotch. I'm gonna chat with my sister. And then I'm gonna make plans ta' continue organizing outside the system, because Biden is absolute fascist scum and the only reason I am voting for him is to save some lives in the short term while we get our shit together and organize to bring the whole system down.",

And I have never seen a debate, not national, not state, not local, not middle school, that was that pathetic.That sounds like hyperbole. It is not. Donald Trump was nearly as bad as he has ever been, scatterbrained, unable to hold on to a thread of thought, lying very obviously and poorly, and yet Biden was so much worse that, relying purely on style and technique and not truth, Trump didn't just win he routed.Again, not hyperbole.So here's what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna finish my scotch. I'm gonna chat with my sister. And then I'm gonna make plans ta' continue organizing outside the system, because Biden is absolute fascist scum and the only reason I am voting for him is to save some lives in the short term while we get our shit together and organize to bring the whole system down.",

And I have never seen a debate, not national, not state, not local, not middle school, that was that pathetic.That sounds like hyperbole. It is not. Donald Trump was nearly as bad as he has ever been, scatterbrained, unable to hold on to a thread of thought, lying very obviously and poorly, and yet Biden was so much worse that, relying purely on style and technique and not truth, Trump didn't just win he routed.Again, not hyperbole.So here's what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna finish my scotch. I'm gonna chat with my sister. And then I'm gonna make plans ta' continue organizing outside the system, because Biden is absolute fascist scum and the only reason I am voting for him is to save some lives in the short term while we get our shit together and organize to bring the whole system down.",

There's no magical actually good candidate who was going to run in with a steel chair.But my sister wanted to watch it, so I poured myself some scotch and joined her.I have watched many, many debates in my life. And I have never seen a debate, not national, not state, not local, not middle school, that was that pathetic.That sounds like hyperbole. It is not. Donald Trump was nearly as bad as he has ever been, scatterbrained, unable to hold on to a thread of thought, lying very obviously and poorly, and yet Biden was so much worse that, relying purely on style and technique and not truth, Trump didn't just win he routed.Again, not hyperbole.So here's what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna finish my scotch. I'm gonna chat with my sister. And then I'm gonna make plans ta' continue organizing outside the system, because Biden is absolute fascist scum and the only reason I am voting for him is to save some lives in the short term while we get our shit together and organize to bring the whole system down.",

And I have never seen a debate, not national, not state, not local, not middle school, that was that pathetic.That sounds like hyperbole. It is not. Donald Trump was nearly as bad as he has ever been, scatterbrained, unable to hold on to a thread of thought, lying very obviously and poorly, and yet Biden was so much worse that, relying purely on style and technique and not truth, Trump didn't just win he routed.Again, not hyperbole.So here's what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna finish my scotch. I'm gonna chat with my sister. And then I'm gonna make plans ta' continue organizing outside the system, because Biden is absolute fascist scum and the only reason I am voting for him is to save some lives in the short term while we get our shit together and organize to bring the whole system down.",

And I have never seen a debate, not national, not state, not local, not middle school, that was that pathetic.That sounds like hyperbole. It is not. Donald Trump was nearly as bad as he has ever been, scatterbrained, unable to hold on to a thread of thought, lying very obviously and poorly, and yet Biden was so much worse that, relying purely on style and technique and not truth, Trump didn't just win he routed.Again, not hyperbole.So here's what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna finish my scotch. I'm gonna chat with my sister. And then I'm gonna make plans ta' continue organizing outside the system, because Biden is absolute fascist scum and the only reason I am voting for him is to save some lives in the short term while we get our shit together and organize to bring the whole system down.",
