Sure. I can appreciate where he wants to take this next, though. First, he wants to know what kind of contingent statements support the performative. He doesn't seem as interested in this & frankly neither am I. It seems a little like more definitions. But maybe there's something useful in there. Second, though, he gets a little more passionate, & I do enjoy when people are passionate. He wants to know not just what are contingent statements, but how do they *relate* to performatives? For me, this implies rituals as having settings. Conditions for rituals. A sort of \"if X then Y\" to human speech, but speech is messy so it's never so elegant.",

Pulling it out of your ass is, actually, what makes it a shitpost. If I just barge into a conversation randomly with, \"Will you marry me?\" that's probably inappropriate. The shitpost works because we have a sense of what's appropriate in this quasi-public sphere. We talk about our day, our lives, our interests. We aren't hear to just say random shit. (Or write a wall of text abot theory!) We have to have clear norms & reasons for our speech to satisfy the general things speech is used for. You cannot barge into a converation on the Fediverse with \"Will you marry me!\" & even have the person say \"lol yes\" & actually *expect that* to result in marriage. Wrong people, almost certainly, if they are strangers; wrong context, surely, for no one would believe it to be true that it would happen here. The infelictious, in other words, is that which is Simply Not Done. (Yet once again, I would remind you that the campus protests raise the question \"Can students affect campus policy in such a way?\" How Things are Done isn't immutible; even ways of doing things carve in stone 4000 years ago have obviously changed. These are negotiations. However, Austin isn't describing the negotiations, which I would argue are more visible through anarchist & Marxist theory--only the rituals themselves.)",

We are still looking at intent in ritual statements, or the way we express social norms. We begin today where we left off yesterday: with the way one ritual sort of \"conditions\" the ritual speech than can come after. How we put statements in order to make our intentions somewhat clearer. The can of worms Austin's opening up here actually has to do with formality, I think. Clarity, too. \"You should put your shoes away,\" you might say to someone. That's pretty clear, & casual. You would expect the person to respond on the subject of the shoes; you are hoping all responses to follow will be shoe-related. But a casual conversation like this leaves the door open to, \"Don't tell me what to do!\" or \"Ha, what are you, my dad?\" So instead you might say, to an acquaintance, \"Oh hey, did you mean to put your shoes away? I almost tripped over them,\" giving more context, an opening to their intentions & acknowledgement of their own internal state of mind &c. But in a more formal context where one has power, one might say, \"I advise you to put your shoes away\" or if\u00a0 you are, say, a consultant, \"It's advisible to put your shoes away\" or \"Best practices are to put one's shoes away upon returning home.\" So it goes, too, in Austin's example. \"I forgive you\" is a much more casual, feeling-based statement, whereas \"I pardon you\" is much more formal & (of course) legal. \"I will move the car,\" you tell your mom, but \"I promise to move the car,\" you say to the parking attendant. The more formal, the less wiggle-room you are allowed ... the less wiggle-room you might claim for yourself....",

We're looking at intentions specifically. Last time we touched on that sometimes we say one thing with the intent of then being able to say something else in the future. My example, very quickly touched upon, is our ability to say \"We're forming a union!\" in order to be able to say, within our lifetime, \"Let's hold a General Strike!\" Of course, there other, everyday applications too. You can't solicit feedback before providing a service, for example. I might serve you up dinner (banana & peanut butter sandwich, natch) with the intent of later asking you \"What did you think of dinner?\" All Austin is saying in conclusion of this sub-point is that having an intent to do the next ritual doesn't say much about insincerity, which is *supposed* to be his current focus.",

Sure. I can appreciate where he wants to take this next, though. First, he wants to know what kind of contingent statements support the performative. He doesn't seem as interested in this & frankly neither am I. It seems a little like more definitions. But maybe there's something useful in there. Second, though, he gets a little more passionate, & I do enjoy when people are passionate. He wants to know not just what are contingent statements, but how do they *relate* to performatives?

Pulling it out of your ass is, actually, what makes it a shitpost. If I just barge into a conversation randomly with, \"Will you marry me?\" that's probably inappropriate. The shitpost works because we have a sense of what's appropriate in this quasi-public sphere. We talk about our day, our lives, our interests. We aren't hear to just say random shit. (Or write a wall of text abot theory!) We have to have clear norms & reasons for our speech to satisfy the general things speech is used for. You cannot barge into a converation on the Fediverse with \"Will you marry me!\" & even have the person say \"lol yes\" & actually *expect that* to result in marriage. Wrong people, almost certainly, if they are strangers; wrong context, surely, for no one would believe it to be true that it would happen here. The infelictious, in other words, is that which is Simply Not Done.

We are still looking at intent in ritual statements, or the way we express social norms. We begin today where we left off yesterday: with the way one ritual sort of \"conditions\" the ritual speech than can come after. How we put statements in order to make our intentions somewhat clearer. The can of worms Austin's opening up here actually has to do with formality, I think. Clarity, too. \"You should put your shoes away,\" you might say to someone. That's pretty clear, & casual. You would expect the person to respond on the subject of the shoes; you are hoping all responses to follow will be shoe-related. But a casual conversation like this leaves the door open to, \"Don't tell me what to do!\" or \"Ha, what are you, my dad?\" So instead you might say, to an acquaintance, \"Oh hey, did you mean to put your shoes away? I almost tripped over them,\" giving more context, an opening to their intentions & acknowledgement of their own internal state of mind &c. But in a more formal context where one has power, one might say, \"I advise you to put your shoes away\" or if\u00a0 you are, say, a consultant, \"It's advisible to put your shoes away\" or \"Best practices are to put one's shoes away upon returning home.\" So it goes, too, in Austin's example. \"I forgive you\" is a much more casual, feeling-based statement, whereas \"I pardon you\" is much more formal & (of course) legal. \"I will move the car,\" you tell your mom, but \"I promise to move the car,\" you say to the parking attendant. The more formal, the less wiggle-room you are allowed ... the less wiggle-room you might claim for yourself....",

We're looking at intentions specifically. Last time we touched on that sometimes we say one thing with the intent of then being able to say something else in the future. My example, very quickly touched upon, is our ability to say \"We're forming a union!\" in order to be able to say, within our lifetime, \"Let's hold a General Strike!\" Of course, there other, everyday applications too. You can't solicit feedback before providing a service, for example. I might serve you up dinner (banana & peanut butter sandwich, natch) with the intent of later asking you \"What did you think of dinner?\" All Austin is saying in conclusion of this sub-point is that having an intent to do the next ritual doesn't say much about insincerity, which is *supposed* to be his current focus.",

Sure. I can appreciate where he wants to take this next, though. First, he wants to know what kind of contingent statements support the performative. He doesn't seem as interested in this & frankly neither am I. It seems a little like more definitions. But maybe there's something useful in there. Second, though, he gets a little more passionate, & I do enjoy when people are passionate. He wants to know not just what are contingent statements, but how do they *relate* to performatives? For me, this implies rituals as having settings. Conditions for rituals. A sort of \"if X then Y\" to human speech, but speech is messy so it's never so elegant.",

Pulling it out of your ass is, actually, what makes it a shitpost. If I just barge into a conversation randomly with, \"Will you marry me?\" that's probably inappropriate. The shitpost works because we have a sense of what's appropriate in this quasi-public sphere. We talk about our day, our lives, our interests. We aren't hear to just say random shit. (Or write a wall of text abot theory!) We have to have clear norms & reasons for our speech to satisfy the general things speech is used for. You cannot barge into a converation on the Fediverse with \"Will you marry me!\" & even have the person say \"lol yes\" & actually *expect that* to result in marriage. Wrong people, almost certainly, if they are strangers; wrong context, surely, for no one would believe it to be true that it would happen here. The infelictious, in other words, is that which is Simply Not Done. (Yet once again, I would remind you that the campus protests raise the question \"Can students affect campus policy in such a way?\" How Things are Done isn't immutible; even ways of doing things carve in stone 4000 years ago have obviously changed. These are negotiations. However, Austin isn't describing the negotiations, which I would argue are more visible through anarchist & Marxist theory--only the rituals themselves.)",

Austin Chapter IV: Infelicities: AbusesPage 45 But there is a constant tendency to make this sort of thing clearer, as for example, when we move from 'I forgive' to 'I pardon' or from 'I will' to 'I intend to' or 'I promise.'----- Welcome back! We are still looking at intent in ritual statements, or the way we express social norms. We begin today where we left off yesterday: with the way one ritual sort of \"conditions\" the ritual speech than can come after. How we put statements in order to make our intentions somewhat clearer. The can of worms Austin's opening up here actually has to do with formality, I think. Clarity, too. \"You should put your shoes away,\" you might say to someone. That's pretty clear, & casual. You would expect the person to respond on the subject of the shoes; you are hoping all responses to follow will be shoe-related. But a casual conversation like this leaves the door open to, \"Don't tell me what to do!\" or \"Ha, what are you, my dad?\" So instead you might say, to an acquaintance, \"Oh hey, did you mean to put your shoes away? I almost tripped over them,\" giving more context, an opening to their intentions & acknowledgement of their own internal state of mind &c. But in a more formal context where one has power, one might say, \"I advise you to put your shoes away\" or if\u00a0 you are, say, a consultant, \"It's advisible to put your shoes away\" or \"Best practices are to put one's shoes away upon returning home.\" So it goes, too, in Austin's example. \"I forgive you\" is a much more casual, feeling-based statement, whereas \"I pardon you\" is much more formal & (of course) legal. \"I will move the car,\" you tell your mom, but \"I promise to move the car,\" you say to the parking attendant. The more formal, the less wiggle-room you are allowed ... the less wiggle-room you might claim for yourself....",

Austin Chapter IV: Infelicities: AbusesPage 44 This does not raise any trouble in principle, however, about the concept of insincerity.----- Welcome back. We are watching Austin open up cans clearly marked \"worms\" & then lament that there's all these worms everywhere. In general we are looking at how social rituals are seen as void. We're looking at intentions specifically. Last time we touched on that sometimes we say one thing with the intent of then being able to say something else in the future. My example, very quickly touched upon, is our ability to say \"We're forming a union!\" in order to be able to say, within our lifetime, \"Let's hold a General Strike!\" Of course, there other, everyday applications too. You can't solicit feedback before providing a service, for example. I might serve you up dinner (banana & peanut butter sandwich, natch) with the intent of later asking you \"What did you think of dinner?\" All Austin is saying in conclusion of this sub-point is that having an intent to do the next ritual doesn't say much about insincerity, which is *supposed* to be his current focus.",

Sure. I can appreciate where he wants to take this next, though. First, he wants to know what kind of contingent statements support the performative. He doesn't seem as interested in this & frankly neither am I. It seems a little like more definitions. But maybe there's something useful in there. Second, though, he gets a little more passionate, & I do enjoy when people are passionate. He wants to know not just what are contingent statements, but how do they *relate* to performatives?

Pulling it out of your ass is, actually, what makes it a shitpost. If I just barge into a conversation randomly with, \"Will you marry me?\" that's probably inappropriate. The shitpost works because we have a sense of what's appropriate in this quasi-public sphere. We talk about our day, our lives, our interests. We aren't hear to just say random shit. (Or write a wall of text abot theory!) We have to have clear norms & reasons for our speech to satisfy the general things speech is used for. You cannot barge into a converation on the Fediverse with \"Will you marry me!\" & even have the person say \"lol yes\" & actually *expect that* to result in marriage. Wrong people, almost certainly, if they are strangers; wrong context, surely, for no one would believe it to be true that it would happen here. The infelictious, in other words, is that which is Simply Not Done. (Yet once again, I would remind you that the campus protests raise the question \"Can students affect campus policy in such a way?\" How Things are Done isn't immutible; even ways of doing things carve in stone 4000 years ago have obviously changed. These are negotiations. However, Austin isn't describing the negotiations, which I would argue are more visible through anarchist & Marxist theory--only the rituals themselves.)",

Austin Chapter IV: Infelicities: AbusesPage 45 But there is a constant tendency to make this sort of thing clearer, as for example, when we move from 'I forgive' to 'I pardon' or from 'I will' to 'I intend to' or 'I promise.'----- Welcome back! We are still looking at intent in ritual statements, or the way we express social norms. We begin today where we left off yesterday: with the way one ritual sort of \"conditions\" the ritual speech than can come after. How we put statements in order to make our intentions somewhat clearer. The can of worms Austin's opening up here actually has to do with formality, I think. Clarity, too. \"You should put your shoes away,\" you might say to someone. That's pretty clear, & casual. You would expect the person to respond on the subject of the shoes; you are hoping all responses to follow will be shoe-related. But a casual conversation like this leaves the door open to, \"Don't tell me what to do!\" or \"Ha, what are you, my dad?\" So instead you might say, to an acquaintance, \"Oh hey, did you mean to put your shoes away? I almost tripped over them,\" giving more context, an opening to their intentions & acknowledgement of their own internal state of mind &c. But in a more formal context where one has power, one might say, \"I advise you to put your shoes away\" or if\u00a0 you are, say, a consultant, \"It's advisible to put your shoes away\" or \"Best practices are to put one's shoes away upon returning home.\" So it goes, too, in Austin's example. \"I forgive you\" is a much more casual, feeling-based statement, whereas \"I pardon you\" is much more formal & (of course) legal. \"I will move the car,\" you tell your mom, but \"I promise to move the car,\" you say to the parking attendant. The more formal, the less wiggle-room you are allowed ... the less wiggle-room you might claim for yourself....",

We're looking at intentions specifically. Last time we touched on that sometimes we say one thing with the intent of then being able to say something else in the future. My example, very quickly touched upon, is our ability to say \"We're forming a union!\" in order to be able to say, within our lifetime, \"Let's hold a General Strike!\" Of course, there other, everyday applications too. You can't solicit feedback before providing a service, for example. I might serve you up dinner (banana & peanut butter sandwich, natch) with the intent of later asking you \"What did you think of dinner?\" All Austin is saying in conclusion of this sub-point is that having an intent to do the next ritual doesn't say much about insincerity, which is *supposed* to be his current focus.",

He doesn't seem as interested in this & frankly neither am I. It seems a little like more definitions. But maybe there's something useful in there. Second, though, he gets a little more passionate, & I do enjoy when people are passionate. He wants to know not just what are contingent statements, but how do they *relate* to performatives?

Pulling it out of your ass is, actually, what makes it a shitpost. If I just barge into a conversation randomly with, \"Will you marry me?\" that's probably inappropriate. The shitpost works because we have a sense of what's appropriate in this quasi-public sphere. We talk about our day, our lives, our interests. We aren't hear to just say random shit. (Or write a wall of text abot theory!) We have to have clear norms & reasons for our speech to satisfy the general things speech is used for. You cannot barge into a converation on the Fediverse with \"Will you marry me!\" & even have the person say \"lol yes\" & actually *expect that* to result in marriage. Wrong people, almost certainly, if they are strangers; wrong context, surely, for no one would believe it to be true that it would happen here.

Austin Chapter IV: Infelicities: AbusesPage 45 But there is a constant tendency to make this sort of thing clearer, as for example, when we move from 'I forgive' to 'I pardon' or from 'I will' to 'I intend to' or 'I promise.'----- Welcome back! We are still looking at intent in ritual statements, or the way we express social norms. We begin today where we left off yesterday: with the way one ritual sort of \"conditions\" the ritual speech than can come after. How we put statements in order to make our intentions somewhat clearer. The can of worms Austin's opening up here actually has to do with formality, I think. Clarity, too. \"You should put your shoes away,\" you might say to someone. That's pretty clear, & casual. You would expect the person to respond on the subject of the shoes; you are hoping all responses to follow will be shoe-related. But a casual conversation like this leaves the door open to, \"Don't tell me what to do!\" or \"Ha, what are you, my dad?\" So instead you might say, to an acquaintance, \"Oh hey, did you mean to put your shoes away? I almost tripped over them,\" giving more context, an opening to their intentions & acknowledgement of their own internal state of mind &c. But in a more formal context where one has power, one might say, \"I advise you to put your shoes away\" or if\u00a0 you are, say, a consultant, \"It's advisible to put your shoes away\" or \"Best practices are to put one's shoes away upon returning home.\" So it goes, too, in Austin's example. \"I forgive you\" is a much more casual, feeling-based statement, whereas \"I pardon you\" is much more formal & (of course) legal. \"I will move the car,\" you tell your mom, but \"I promise to move the car,\" you say to the parking attendant. The more formal, the less wiggle-room you are allowed ... the less wiggle-room you might claim for yourself....",

We're looking at intentions specifically. Last time we touched on that sometimes we say one thing with the intent of then being able to say something else in the future. My example, very quickly touched upon, is our ability to say \"We're forming a union!\" in order to be able to say, within our lifetime, \"Let's hold a General Strike!\" Of course, there other, everyday applications too. You can't solicit feedback before providing a service, for example. I might serve you up dinner (banana & peanut butter sandwich, natch) with the intent of later asking you \"What did you think of dinner?\" All Austin is saying in conclusion of this sub-point is that having an intent to do the next ritual doesn't say much about insincerity, which is *supposed* to be his current focus.",

He doesn't seem as interested in this & frankly neither am I. It seems a little like more definitions. But maybe there's something useful in there.

Pulling it out of your ass is, actually, what makes it a shitpost. If I just barge into a conversation randomly with, \"Will you marry me?\" that's probably inappropriate. The shitpost works because we have a sense of what's appropriate in this quasi-public sphere. We talk about our day, our lives, our interests. We aren't hear to just say random shit. (Or write a wall of text abot theory!) We have to have clear norms & reasons for our speech to satisfy the general things speech is used for. You cannot barge into a converation on the Fediverse with \"Will you marry me!\" & even have the person say \"lol yes\" & actually *expect that* to result in marriage. Wrong people, almost certainly, if they are strangers; wrong context, surely, for no one would believe it to be true that it would happen here.

Austin Chapter IV: Infelicities: AbusesPage 45 But there is a constant tendency to make this sort of thing clearer, as for example, when we move from 'I forgive' to 'I pardon' or from 'I will' to 'I intend to' or 'I promise.'----- Welcome back! We are still looking at intent in ritual statements, or the way we express social norms. We begin today where we left off yesterday: with the way one ritual sort of \"conditions\" the ritual speech than can come after. How we put statements in order to make our intentions somewhat clearer. The can of worms Austin's opening up here actually has to do with formality, I think. Clarity, too. \"You should put your shoes away,\" you might say to someone. That's pretty clear, & casual. You would expect the person to respond on the subject of the shoes; you are hoping all responses to follow will be shoe-related. But a casual conversation like this leaves the door open to, \"Don't tell me what to do!\" or \"Ha, what are you, my dad?\" So instead you might say, to an acquaintance, \"Oh hey, did you mean to put your shoes away? I almost tripped over them,\" giving more context, an opening to their intentions & acknowledgement of their own internal state of mind &c. But in a more formal context where one has power, one might say, \"I advise you to put your shoes away\" or if\u00a0 you are, say, a consultant, \"It's advisible to put your shoes away\" or \"Best practices are to put one's shoes away upon returning home.\" So it goes, too, in Austin's example. \"I forgive you\" is a much more casual, feeling-based statement, whereas \"I pardon you\" is much more formal & (of course) legal. \"I will move the car,\" you tell your mom, but \"I promise to move the car,\" you say to the parking attendant. The more formal, the less wiggle-room you are allowed ... the less wiggle-room you might claim for yourself....",

We're looking at intentions specifically. Last time we touched on that sometimes we say one thing with the intent of then being able to say something else in the future. My example, very quickly touched upon, is our ability to say \"We're forming a union!\" in order to be able to say, within our lifetime, \"Let's hold a General Strike!\" Of course, there other, everyday applications too. You can't solicit feedback before providing a service, for example. I might serve you up dinner (banana & peanut butter sandwich, natch) with the intent of later asking you \"What did you think of dinner?\" All Austin is saying in conclusion of this sub-point is that having an intent to do the next ritual doesn't say much about insincerity, which is *supposed* to be his current focus.",

Pulling it out of your ass is, actually, what makes it a shitpost. If I just barge into a conversation randomly with, \"Will you marry me?\" that's probably inappropriate. The shitpost works because we have a sense of what's appropriate in this quasi-public sphere. We talk about our day, our lives, our interests. We aren't hear to just say random shit. (Or write a wall of text abot theory!) We have to have clear norms & reasons for our speech to satisfy the general things speech is used for. You cannot barge into a converation on the Fediverse with \"Will you marry me!\" & even have the person say \"lol yes\" & actually *expect that* to result in marriage. Wrong people, almost certainly, if they are strangers; wrong context, surely, for no one would believe it to be true that it would happen here.

We have concluded Austin's little list of the impacts of thought, feeling, & intent. We have effectively summed up his thoughts on sincerity in ritual. We have seen that it is only clear in the long-term & in the context of other rituals, too. We need a more or less clear relationship between rituals in order for someone's sincerity to become clear. We cannot know someone's mental state, after all, we can only draw conclusions in inference from their other words & actions.

We are still looking at intent in ritual statements, or the way we express social norms. We begin today where we left off yesterday: with the way one ritual sort of \"conditions\" the ritual speech than can come after. How we put statements in order to make our intentions somewhat clearer. The can of worms Austin's opening up here actually has to do with formality, I think. Clarity, too. \"You should put your shoes away,\" you might say to someone. That's pretty clear, & casual. You would expect the person to respond on the subject of the shoes; you are hoping all responses to follow will be shoe-related. But a casual conversation like this leaves the door open to, \"Don't tell me what to do!\" or \"Ha, what are you, my dad?\" So instead you might say, to an acquaintance, \"Oh hey, did you mean to put your shoes away? I almost tripped over them,\" giving more context, an opening to their intentions & acknowledgement of their own internal state of mind &c. But in a more formal context where one has power, one might say, \"I advise you to put your shoes away\" or if\u00a0 you are, say, a consultant, \"It's advisible to put your shoes away\" or \"Best practices are to put one's shoes away upon returning home.\" So it goes, too, in Austin's example. \"I forgive you\" is a much more casual, feeling-based statement, whereas \"I pardon you\" is much more formal & (of course) legal. \"I will move the car,\" you tell your mom, but \"I promise to move the car,\" you say to the parking attendant. The more formal, the less wiggle-room you are allowed ... the less wiggle-room you might claim for yourself....",

We're looking at intentions specifically. Last time we touched on that sometimes we say one thing with the intent of then being able to say something else in the future. My example, very quickly touched upon, is our ability to say \"We're forming a union!\" in order to be able to say, within our lifetime, \"Let's hold a General Strike!\" Of course, there other, everyday applications too. You can't solicit feedback before providing a service, for example. I might serve you up dinner (banana & peanut butter sandwich, natch) with the intent of later asking you \"What did you think of dinner?\" All Austin is saying in conclusion of this sub-point is that having an intent to do the next ritual doesn't say much about insincerity, which is *supposed* to be his current focus.",
