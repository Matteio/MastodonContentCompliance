We've just run into the issue where the latest release (3815.2.3) isn't yet available on Azure even though it was meant to be released May 22nd. \ud83d\ude1e Even the docs here (https://www.flatcar.org/docs/latest/installing/cloud/azure/) are wrong. It says \"The current version is Flatcar Container Linux 3815.2.3.\" but when you run the command provided right below that you actually get  3815.2.2. Any idea what may have gone wrong or where I should raise it?",
