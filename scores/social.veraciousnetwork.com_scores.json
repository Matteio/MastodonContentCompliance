NOPE!  Original developer messages a lead on Teams with a link to the merge request.  Lead cherry picks branch or completes merge and manually deploys to QA.Original developer then has to pre-QA that the work is ready to be QA'd in the correct environment, reassigns the ticket to the QA lead, and messages the QA lead on Teams that the issue is ready for testing.QA lead inevitably asks if it's working as expected in test, (which is odd because I would expect that's the responsibility of QA).QA will then message the original developer on Teams that the work is approved, who then original dev needs to message the Lead on Teams that the work is ready for prod.

NOPE!  Original developer messages a lead on Teams with a link to the merge request.  Lead cherry picks branch or completes merge and manually deploys to QA.Original developer then has to pre-QA that the work is ready to be QA'd in the correct environment, reassigns the ticket to the QA lead, and messages the QA lead on Teams that the issue is ready for testing.QA lead inevitably asks if it's working as expected in test, (which is odd because I would expect that's the responsibility of QA).QA will then message the original developer on Teams that the work is approved, who then original dev needs to message the Lead on Teams that the work is ready for prod.

NOPE!  Original developer messages a lead on Teams with a link to the merge request.  Lead cherry picks branch or completes merge and manually deploys to QA.Original developer then has to pre-QA that the work is ready to be QA'd in the correct environment, reassigns the ticket to the QA lead, and messages the QA lead on Teams that the issue is ready for testing.QA lead inevitably asks if it's working as expected in test, (which is odd because I would expect that's the responsibility of QA).QA will then message the original developer on Teams that the work is approved, who then original dev needs to message the Lead on Teams that the work is ready for prod.
