Here he makes the point that religion in general serves some purpose and that one God for all all of man and one Satan, as a kind of nessesary device, was a blunt force superior propaganda. Which is unusual because he also claims it is poisonous. One might say this is analogous to leftism. But in order for that ideology to have real force, I assume jews are needed.He also says Zoastrianism which was this monotheism idea was created by a single aryan man. All in all confusing but brings home the point that perhaps it IS nessesary to honestly argue why this is not only bunk but also poison which jews may not be entirely responsible for.",
