I don't expect anyone to be particularly interested in this, it's just some thoughts I needed to get out of my head. In 2017, I knew nothing about networking, I didn't even have a particularly strong grasp on what a subnet mask was for. I had a little meltdown while I was trying to escape my deadend job in insurance and started on a journey to certifying with my CCNA. In 2018, I achieved the first half of it and still struggled to find work (featuring sexism and a conservative job market/city) until later that year when I got my break onto a service desk.I completed my CCNA in 2019 and used those skills extensively in my first non-helpdesk job, though they didn't want to admit they were using my skills, so wouldn't pay me more or even reimburse my certification.In 2022, I passed my RHCSA and it filled in a lot of little gaps that I'd had from having self-taught myself Linux as a teenager (and trial by fire in a job). I did this again under my own financing because I needed the tax deduction that year.Then last year to renew my CCNA, I studied and sat for the Cisco Certified DevNet Associate - part of it was to get the renewal and part of it was because I was interested in breaking into the DevOps space. It taught me heaps about the basic concepts and I used those in home projects. A few months later, I got a job in that space and have been working towards my CKA - this time, paid for by my employer. It's interesting how many little things each of these certs has taught me that I hadn't picked up in my own self-study and how much those foundational skills have helped me build more intermediate ones. To me, the certificate is like the shiny little medal I get at the end and whilst I strictly don't need it, my lizard brain wants it.",

I don't expect anyone to be particularly interested in this, it's just some thoughts I needed to get out of my head. In 2017, I knew nothing about networking, I didn't even have a particularly strong grasp on what a subnet mask was for. I had a little meltdown while I was trying to escape my deadend job in insurance and started on a journey to certifying with my CCNA. In 2018, I achieved the first half of it and still struggled to find work (featuring sexism and a conservative job market/city) until later that year when I got my break onto a service desk.I completed my CCNA in 2019 and used those skills extensively in my first non-helpdesk job, though they didn't want to admit they were using my skills, so wouldn't pay me more or even reimburse my certification.In 2022, I passed my RHCSA and it filled in a lot of little gaps that I'd had from having self-taught myself Linux as a teenager (and trial by fire in a job). I did this again under my own financing because I needed the tax deduction that year.Then last year to renew my CCNA, I studied and sat for the Cisco Certified DevNet Associate - part of it was to get the renewal and part of it was because I was interested in breaking into the DevOps space. It taught me heaps about the basic concepts and I used those in home projects. A few months later, I got a job in that space and have been working towards my CKA - this time, paid for by my employer. It's interesting how many little things each of these certs has taught me that I hadn't picked up in my own self-study and how much those foundational skills have helped me build more intermediate ones. To me, the certificate is like the shiny little medal I get at the end and whilst I strictly don't need it, my lizard brain wants it.",

I don't expect anyone to be particularly interested in this, it's just some thoughts I needed to get out of my head. In 2017, I knew nothing about networking, I didn't even have a particularly strong grasp on what a subnet mask was for. I had a little meltdown while I was trying to escape my deadend job in insurance and started on a journey to certifying with my CCNA. In 2018, I achieved the first half of it and still struggled to find work (featuring sexism and a conservative job market/city) until later that year when I got my break onto a service desk.I completed my CCNA in 2019 and used those skills extensively in my first non-helpdesk job, though they didn't want to admit they were using my skills, so wouldn't pay me more or even reimburse my certification.In 2022, I passed my RHCSA and it filled in a lot of little gaps that I'd had from having self-taught myself Linux as a teenager (and trial by fire in a job). I did this again under my own financing because I needed the tax deduction that year.Then last year to renew my CCNA, I studied and sat for the Cisco Certified DevNet Associate - part of it was to get the renewal and part of it was because I was interested in breaking into the DevOps space. It taught me heaps about the basic concepts and I used those in home projects. A few months later, I got a job in that space and have been working towards my CKA - this time, paid for by my employer. It's interesting how many little things each of these certs has taught me that I hadn't picked up in my own self-study and how much those foundational skills have helped me build more intermediate ones. To me, the certificate is like the shiny little medal I get at the end and whilst I strictly don't need it, my lizard brain wants it.",

I don't expect anyone to be particularly interested in this, it's just some thoughts I needed to get out of my head. In 2017, I knew nothing about networking, I didn't even have a particularly strong grasp on what a subnet mask was for. I had a little meltdown while I was trying to escape my deadend job in insurance and started on a journey to certifying with my CCNA. In 2018, I achieved the first half of it and still struggled to find work (featuring sexism and a conservative job market/city) until later that year when I got my break onto a service desk.I completed my CCNA in 2019 and used those skills extensively in my first non-helpdesk job, though they didn't want to admit they were using my skills, so wouldn't pay me more or even reimburse my certification.In 2022, I passed my RHCSA and it filled in a lot of little gaps that I'd had from having self-taught myself Linux as a teenager (and trial by fire in a job). I did this again under my own financing because I needed the tax deduction that year.Then last year to renew my CCNA, I studied and sat for the Cisco Certified DevNet Associate - part of it was to get the renewal and part of it was because I was interested in breaking into the DevOps space. It taught me heaps about the basic concepts and I used those in home projects. A few months later, I got a job in that space and have been working towards my CKA - this time, paid for by my employer. It's interesting how many little things each of these certs has taught me that I hadn't picked up in my own self-study and how much those foundational skills have helped me build more intermediate ones. To me, the certificate is like the shiny little medal I get at the end and whilst I strictly don't need it, my lizard brain wants it.",

I don't expect anyone to be particularly interested in this, it's just some thoughts I needed to get out of my head. In 2017, I knew nothing about networking, I didn't even have a particularly strong grasp on what a subnet mask was for. I had a little meltdown while I was trying to escape my deadend job in insurance and started on a journey to certifying with my CCNA. In 2018, I achieved the first half of it and still struggled to find work (featuring sexism and a conservative job market/city) until later that year when I got my break onto a service desk.I completed my CCNA in 2019 and used those skills extensively in my first non-helpdesk job, though they didn't want to admit they were using my skills, so wouldn't pay me more or even reimburse my certification.In 2022, I passed my RHCSA and it filled in a lot of little gaps that I'd had from having self-taught myself Linux as a teenager (and trial by fire in a job). I did this again under my own financing because I needed the tax deduction that year.Then last year to renew my CCNA, I studied and sat for the Cisco Certified DevNet Associate - part of it was to get the renewal and part of it was because I was interested in breaking into the DevOps space. It taught me heaps about the basic concepts and I used those in home projects. A few months later, I got a job in that space and have been working towards my CKA - this time, paid for by my employer. It's interesting how many little things each of these certs has taught me that I hadn't picked up in my own self-study and how much those foundational skills have helped me build more intermediate ones. To me, the certificate is like the shiny little medal I get at the end and whilst I strictly don't need it, my lizard brain wants it.",

I don't expect anyone to be particularly interested in this, it's just some thoughts I needed to get out of my head. In 2017, I knew nothing about networking, I didn't even have a particularly strong grasp on what a subnet mask was for. I had a little meltdown while I was trying to escape my deadend job in insurance and started on a journey to certifying with my CCNA. In 2018, I achieved the first half of it and still struggled to find work (featuring sexism and a conservative job market/city) until later that year when I got my break onto a service desk.I completed my CCNA in 2019 and used those skills extensively in my first non-helpdesk job, though they didn't want to admit they were using my skills, so wouldn't pay me more or even reimburse my certification.In 2022, I passed my RHCSA and it filled in a lot of little gaps that I'd had from having self-taught myself Linux as a teenager (and trial by fire in a job). I did this again under my own financing because I needed the tax deduction that year.Then last year to renew my CCNA, I studied and sat for the Cisco Certified DevNet Associate - part of it was to get the renewal and part of it was because I was interested in breaking into the DevOps space. It taught me heaps about the basic concepts and I used those in home projects. A few months later, I got a job in that space and have been working towards my CKA - this time, paid for by my employer. It's interesting how many little things each of these certs has taught me that I hadn't picked up in my own self-study and how much those foundational skills have helped me build more intermediate ones. To me, the certificate is like the shiny little medal I get at the end and whilst I strictly don't need it, my lizard brain wants it.",
