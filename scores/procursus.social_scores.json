As well as hierarchy of evaluation, for example evaluate strings first, ints first, etc. It's pretty much a mess of patching this, adding hacky support for one feature that one evaluator uses then updating it for all evaluators to use them while determining hierarchy in a logical manner.

            "text": "To clarify on my previous post about js:The reason why security is non-existent on js is due to it being a client-side language. Essentially, your browser acts like a mailbox queueing webpage \"X\", \"Y\" etc... to it's Javascript runtime. From there the Javascript is then compiled and executed FROM YOUR DEVICE. Meaning most security checks aside from obfuscation are useless. Take a normal flask server for instance:@app.route(\"myroute\")def myroute():  # process data here  return dataThere's no actual way to find out for sure what processing happened unless the source is public or you have a good guess how it's used because the only part actually executed on device is the returned data. Meanwhile, on vanilla js, the processing happens via the on device file. It's kinda like a paradox. How are you supposed to secure your file when it has to be decrypted or ran somehow. Right now, as far as I know minified js is a good form of obfuscation. One other similar issue is api-based requests. For example, while processing the data the server might make a request to \"https://xyz.com\" and you would be unable to know. However with js, you can simply do this:It genuinely is that easy to trace requests via js. A more popular example would be twitter's broadcasts. Simply go to any broadcast, search '.m3u8' in the network panel and you'll see direct links which can be utilized to download the broadcast from. (The example is from a malicious site known as \"iremovalra1n\")",

            "text": "To clarify on my previous post about js:The reason why security is non-existent on js is due to it being a client-side language. Essentially, your browser acts like a mailbox queueing webpage \"X\", \"Y\" etc... to it's Javascript runtime. From there the Javascript is then compiled and executed FROM YOUR DEVICE. Meaning most security checks aside from obfuscation are useless. Take a normal flask server for instance:@app.route(\"myroute\")def myroute():  # process data here  return dataThere's no actual way to find out for sure what processing happened unless the source is public or you have a good guess how it's used because the only part actually executed on device is the returned data. Meanwhile, on vanilla js, the processing happens via the on device file. It's kinda like a paradox. How are you supposed to secure your file when it has to be decrypted or ran somehow. Right now, as far as I know minified js is a good form of obfuscation. One other similar issue is api-based requests. For example, while processing the data the server might make a request to \"https://xyz.com\" and you would be unable to know. However with js, you can simply do this:It genuinely is that easy to trace requests via js. A more popular example would be twitter's broadcasts. Simply go to any broadcast, search '.m3u8' in the network panel and you'll see direct links which can be utilized to download the broadcast from. (The example is from a malicious site known as \"iremovalra1n\")",

As well as hierarchy of evaluation, for example evaluate strings first, ints first, etc. It's pretty much a mess of patching this, adding hacky support for one feature that one evaluator uses then updating it for all evaluators to use them while determining hierarchy in a logical manner.

            "text": "To clarify on my previous post about js:The reason why security is non-existent on js is due to it being a client-side language. Essentially, your browser acts like a mailbox queueing webpage \"X\", \"Y\" etc... to it's Javascript runtime. From there the Javascript is then compiled and executed FROM YOUR DEVICE. Meaning most security checks aside from obfuscation are useless. Take a normal flask server for instance:@app.route(\"myroute\")def myroute():  # process data here  return dataThere's no actual way to find out for sure what processing happened unless the source is public or you have a good guess how it's used because the only part actually executed on device is the returned data. Meanwhile, on vanilla js, the processing happens via the on device file. It's kinda like a paradox. How are you supposed to secure your file when it has to be decrypted or ran somehow. Right now, as far as I know minified js is a good form of obfuscation. One other similar issue is api-based requests. For example, while processing the data the server might make a request to \"https://xyz.com\" and you would be unable to know. However with js, you can simply do this:It genuinely is that easy to trace requests via js. A more popular example would be twitter's broadcasts. Simply go to any broadcast, search '.m3u8' in the network panel and you'll see direct links which can be utilized to download the broadcast from. (The example is from a malicious site known as \"iremovalra1n\")",

As well as hierarchy of evaluation, for example evaluate strings first, ints first, etc. It's pretty much a mess of patching this, adding hacky support for one feature that one evaluator uses then updating it for all evaluators to use them while determining hierarchy in a logical manner.

            "text": "To clarify on my previous post about js:The reason why security is non-existent on js is due to it being a client-side language. Essentially, your browser acts like a mailbox queueing webpage \"X\", \"Y\" etc... to it's Javascript runtime. From there the Javascript is then compiled and executed FROM YOUR DEVICE. Meaning most security checks aside from obfuscation are useless. Take a normal flask server for instance:@app.route(\"myroute\")def myroute():  # process data here  return dataThere's no actual way to find out for sure what processing happened unless the source is public or you have a good guess how it's used because the only part actually executed on device is the returned data. Meanwhile, on vanilla js, the processing happens via the on device file. It's kinda like a paradox. How are you supposed to secure your file when it has to be decrypted or ran somehow. Right now, as far as I know minified js is a good form of obfuscation. One other similar issue is api-based requests. For example, while processing the data the server might make a request to \"https://xyz.com\" and you would be unable to know. However with js, you can simply do this:It genuinely is that easy to trace requests via js. A more popular example would be twitter's broadcasts. Simply go to any broadcast, search '.m3u8' in the network panel and you'll see direct links which can be utilized to download the broadcast from. (The example is from a malicious site known as \"iremovalra1n\")",
