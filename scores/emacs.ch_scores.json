Patch tpm2_pkcs11's src/lib/slot.c:slot_get_info to add the CKF_REMOVABLE_DEVICE flag to the slot (sssd ignores non-removable devices). Install the patched version in the usual location, often /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/pkcs11. You can check that it worked with \"pkcs11-tool -v -L --module /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/pkcs11/libtpm2_pkcs11.so\" which should now include \"removable device\" in the slot flags.2. Set up a token in /etc/tpm2_pkcs11 with tpm2_ptool or whatever (this can and probably should be owned by root with mode 0600). Provision a suitable certificate, usually the same as on your trad-smartcard.3. Make /dev/tpmrm0 accessible for root: setfacl -m u:root:rw /dev/tpmrm0 (a udev rule can be set up to make this permanent). sssd's default CapabilityBoundingSet prevents p11_child (forked by sssd_pam) from overriding the owner/group for write access even as root.(4. Check SELinux/Apparmor restrictions if you're enforcing that stuff on sssd.)\"pamtester lightdm your_username authenticate\" should now prompt for the virtual smartcard PIN.If you haven't done it yet, use tpm2_dictionarylockout to set up the DA lockout and then use tpm2_changeauth to set a password on the lockout control object (using a random string and throwing it out is what Windows does and is probably a good idea). Setting up p11-kit-remote to talk to localhost might make it possible to skip some of the permission fuckery.Virtual smartcards may not be a good idea on a portable device (especially since tpm2_pkcs11 doesn't support PCR binding) but probably no worse than password auth on a desktop :shrug:",

I left the cape at 5:30 this morning and headed back up the eastern cost. The weather was perfect. Back near the long beach a local told me not to treck down the rockier path, since the rain had washed out the usual sand bridge. I went anyway and jumped the tiny river that had formed. No issue.By 10:30 I was back at the inn from the previous day and grabbed a quick lunch. That\u2019s already a good 20km walk. There, I talked with the owner about my options for the evening. I was thinking about heading for a campsite a few hours up the road. He suggested I instead go another 10+ km further than that to a dam, saying there\u2019s a park there where I could sleep wherever I want.I\u2019ll get to the campsite first and then weigh my options.By 15:00 I was at the campsite. The road to it peeled off from the main road and wound down to the riverside. There wasn\u2019t a soul in sight. Furthermore, I had no water. None even for drinking, let alone cooking. I had drank it all working my way up the narrow yet scenic mountain road. There were outdoor taps here, but no way to know where they draw from. I checked my map again. Another few kilometers to Mihara, and then another handful more after that to the dam. It was only 15:00\u2026I got to the dam just past 18:00. I was active for a full 12 hours today. And you know what? I was in pretty good shape. Nowhere near as beaten up as I thought I\u2019d be. I had pasta for dinner, alone(?) in the mountains.Animals: 3 cats, 2 snakes, 4 \u201cbadgers\u201dOsettai: Citrus, nigiri, candiesPost-trip Addendum:This was the furthest I ever walked in one day. I thought to myself at the time \u201cI could have gone 50\u201d, which means if I really needed to push it or someone\u2019s life was on the line, who knows how far I could go?As I was setting up my tent, a gray van rolled slowly by. I couldn\u2019t see in the windows; the van was filled with trash and belongings. The nearby dam had a control building where employees must be during the day, and I had noticed a number of cars in its parking lot, and yet the building itself seemed dark. My guess was that the cars actually belonged to nomads, just one step away from homelessness.

Patch tpm2_pkcs11's src/lib/slot.c:slot_get_info to add the CKF_REMOVABLE_DEVICE flag to the slot (sssd ignores non-removable devices). Install the patched version in the usual location, often /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/pkcs11. You can check that it worked with \"pkcs11-tool -v -L --module /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/pkcs11/libtpm2_pkcs11.so\" which should now include \"removable device\" in the slot flags.2. Set up a token in /etc/tpm2_pkcs11 with tpm2_ptool or whatever (this can and probably should be owned by root with mode 0600). Provision a suitable certificate, usually the same as on your trad-smartcard.3. Make /dev/tpmrm0 accessible for root: setfacl -m u:root:rw /dev/tpmrm0 (a udev rule can be set up to make this permanent). sssd's default CapabilityBoundingSet prevents p11_child (forked by sssd_pam) from overriding the owner/group for write access even as root.(4. Check SELinux/Apparmor restrictions if you're enforcing that stuff on sssd.)\"pamtester lightdm your_username authenticate\" should now prompt for the virtual smartcard PIN.If you haven't done it yet, use tpm2_dictionarylockout to set up the DA lockout and then use tpm2_changeauth to set a password on the lockout control object (using a random string and throwing it out is what Windows does and is probably a good idea). Setting up p11-kit-remote to talk to localhost might make it possible to skip some of the permission fuckery.Virtual smartcards may not be a good idea on a portable device (especially since tpm2_pkcs11 doesn't support PCR binding) but probably no worse than password auth on a desktop :shrug:",

            "text": "Henro Pilgrimage - Day 23 - May 8 (47km)Today I got a glimpse of my limits. At the moment I\u2019m set up for the evening at a large dam in the mountains. I left the cape at 5:30 this morning and headed back up the eastern cost. The weather was perfect. Back near the long beach a local told me not to treck down the rockier path, since the rain had washed out the usual sand bridge. I went anyway and jumped the tiny river that had formed. No issue.By 10:30 I was back at the inn from the previous day and grabbed a quick lunch. That\u2019s already a good 20km walk. There, I talked with the owner about my options for the evening. I was thinking about heading for a campsite a few hours up the road. He suggested I instead go another 10+ km further than that to a dam, saying there\u2019s a park there where I could sleep wherever I want.I\u2019ll get to the campsite first and then weigh my options.By 15:00 I was at the campsite. The road to it peeled off from the main road and wound down to the riverside. There wasn\u2019t a soul in sight. Furthermore, I had no water. None even for drinking, let alone cooking. I had drank it all working my way up the narrow yet scenic mountain road. There were outdoor taps here, but no way to know where they draw from. I checked my map again. Another few kilometers to Mihara, and then another handful more after that to the dam. It was only 15:00\u2026I got to the dam just past 18:00. I was active for a full 12 hours today. And you know what? I was in pretty good shape. Nowhere near as beaten up as I thought I\u2019d be. I had pasta for dinner, alone(?) in the mountains.Animals: 3 cats, 2 snakes, 4 \u201cbadgers\u201dOsettai: Citrus, nigiri, candiesPost-trip Addendum:This was the furthest I ever walked in one day. I thought to myself at the time \u201cI could have gone 50\u201d, which means if I really needed to push it or someone\u2019s life was on the line, who knows how far I could go?As I was setting up my tent, a gray van rolled slowly by. I couldn\u2019t see in the windows; the van was filled with trash and belongings. The nearby dam had a control building where employees must be during the day, and I had noticed a number of cars in its parking lot, and yet the building itself seemed dark. My guess was that the cars actually belonged to nomads, just one step away from homelessness.

Patch tpm2_pkcs11's src/lib/slot.c:slot_get_info to add the CKF_REMOVABLE_DEVICE flag to the slot (sssd ignores non-removable devices). Install the patched version in the usual location, often /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/pkcs11. You can check that it worked with \"pkcs11-tool -v -L --module /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/pkcs11/libtpm2_pkcs11.so\" which should now include \"removable device\" in the slot flags.2. Set up a token in /etc/tpm2_pkcs11 with tpm2_ptool or whatever (this can and probably should be owned by root with mode 0600). Provision a suitable certificate, usually the same as on your trad-smartcard.3. Make /dev/tpmrm0 accessible for root: setfacl -m u:root:rw /dev/tpmrm0 (a udev rule can be set up to make this permanent). sssd's default CapabilityBoundingSet prevents p11_child (forked by sssd_pam) from overriding the owner/group for write access even as root.(4. Check SELinux/Apparmor restrictions if you're enforcing that stuff on sssd.)\"pamtester lightdm your_username authenticate\" should now prompt for the virtual smartcard PIN.If you haven't done it yet, use tpm2_dictionarylockout to set up the DA lockout and then use tpm2_changeauth to set a password on the lockout control object (using a random string and throwing it out is what Windows does and is probably a good idea). Setting up p11-kit-remote to talk to localhost might make it possible to skip some of the permission fuckery.Virtual smartcards may not be a good idea on a portable device (especially since tpm2_pkcs11 doesn't support PCR binding) but probably no worse than password auth on a desktop :shrug:",

            "text": "Henro Pilgrimage - Day 23 - May 8 (47km)Today I got a glimpse of my limits. At the moment I\u2019m set up for the evening at a large dam in the mountains. I left the cape at 5:30 this morning and headed back up the eastern cost. The weather was perfect. Back near the long beach a local told me not to treck down the rockier path, since the rain had washed out the usual sand bridge. I went anyway and jumped the tiny river that had formed. No issue.By 10:30 I was back at the inn from the previous day and grabbed a quick lunch. That\u2019s already a good 20km walk. There, I talked with the owner about my options for the evening. I was thinking about heading for a campsite a few hours up the road. He suggested I instead go another 10+ km further than that to a dam, saying there\u2019s a park there where I could sleep wherever I want.I\u2019ll get to the campsite first and then weigh my options.By 15:00 I was at the campsite. The road to it peeled off from the main road and wound down to the riverside. There wasn\u2019t a soul in sight. Furthermore, I had no water. None even for drinking, let alone cooking. I had drank it all working my way up the narrow yet scenic mountain road. There were outdoor taps here, but no way to know where they draw from. I checked my map again. Another few kilometers to Mihara, and then another handful more after that to the dam. It was only 15:00\u2026I got to the dam just past 18:00. I was active for a full 12 hours today. And you know what? I was in pretty good shape. Nowhere near as beaten up as I thought I\u2019d be. I had pasta for dinner, alone(?) in the mountains.Animals: 3 cats, 2 snakes, 4 \u201cbadgers\u201dOsettai: Citrus, nigiri, candiesPost-trip Addendum:This was the furthest I ever walked in one day. I thought to myself at the time \u201cI could have gone 50\u201d, which means if I really needed to push it or someone\u2019s life was on the line, who knows how far I could go?As I was setting up my tent, a gray van rolled slowly by. I couldn\u2019t see in the windows; the van was filled with trash and belongings. The nearby dam had a control building where employees must be during the day, and I had noticed a number of cars in its parking lot, and yet the building itself seemed dark. My guess was that the cars actually belonged to nomads, just one step away from homelessness.

Patch tpm2_pkcs11's src/lib/slot.c:slot_get_info to add the CKF_REMOVABLE_DEVICE flag to the slot (sssd ignores non-removable devices). Install the patched version in the usual location, often /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/pkcs11. You can check that it worked with \"pkcs11-tool -v -L --module /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/pkcs11/libtpm2_pkcs11.so\" which should now include \"removable device\" in the slot flags.2. Set up a token in /etc/tpm2_pkcs11 with tpm2_ptool or whatever (this can and probably should be owned by root with mode 0600). Provision a suitable certificate, usually the same as on your trad-smartcard.3. Make /dev/tpmrm0 accessible for root: setfacl -m u:root:rw /dev/tpmrm0 (a udev rule can be set up to make this permanent). sssd's default CapabilityBoundingSet prevents p11_child (forked by sssd_pam) from overriding the owner/group for write access even as root.(4. Check SELinux/Apparmor restrictions if you're enforcing that stuff on sssd.)\"pamtester lightdm your_username authenticate\" should now prompt for the virtual smartcard PIN.If you haven't done it yet, use tpm2_dictionarylockout to set up the DA lockout and then use tpm2_changeauth to set a password on the lockout control object (using a random string and throwing it out is what Windows does and is probably a good idea). Setting up p11-kit-remote to talk to localhost might make it possible to skip some of the permission fuckery.Virtual smartcards may not be a good idea on a portable device (especially since tpm2_pkcs11 doesn't support PCR binding) but probably no worse than password auth on a desktop :shrug:",

            "text": "Henro Pilgrimage - Day 23 - May 8 (47km)Today I got a glimpse of my limits. At the moment I\u2019m set up for the evening at a large dam in the mountains. I left the cape at 5:30 this morning and headed back up the eastern cost. The weather was perfect. Back near the long beach a local told me not to treck down the rockier path, since the rain had washed out the usual sand bridge. I went anyway and jumped the tiny river that had formed. No issue.By 10:30 I was back at the inn from the previous day and grabbed a quick lunch. That\u2019s already a good 20km walk. There, I talked with the owner about my options for the evening. I was thinking about heading for a campsite a few hours up the road. He suggested I instead go another 10+ km further than that to a dam, saying there\u2019s a park there where I could sleep wherever I want.I\u2019ll get to the campsite first and then weigh my options.By 15:00 I was at the campsite. The road to it peeled off from the main road and wound down to the riverside. There wasn\u2019t a soul in sight. Furthermore, I had no water. None even for drinking, let alone cooking. I had drank it all working my way up the narrow yet scenic mountain road. There were outdoor taps here, but no way to know where they draw from. I checked my map again. Another few kilometers to Mihara, and then another handful more after that to the dam. It was only 15:00\u2026I got to the dam just past 18:00. I was active for a full 12 hours today. And you know what? I was in pretty good shape. Nowhere near as beaten up as I thought I\u2019d be. I had pasta for dinner, alone(?) in the mountains.Animals: 3 cats, 2 snakes, 4 \u201cbadgers\u201dOsettai: Citrus, nigiri, candiesPost-trip Addendum:This was the furthest I ever walked in one day. I thought to myself at the time \u201cI could have gone 50\u201d, which means if I really needed to push it or someone\u2019s life was on the line, who knows how far I could go?As I was setting up my tent, a gray van rolled slowly by. I couldn\u2019t see in the windows; the van was filled with trash and belongings. The nearby dam had a control building where employees must be during the day, and I had noticed a number of cars in its parking lot, and yet the building itself seemed dark. My guess was that the cars actually belonged to nomads, just one step away from homelessness.
