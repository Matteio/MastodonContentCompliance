I look back so often because it\u2019s there where I find the truth of us. It\u2019s there where our seeds were planted. Did we do this the easy way? No. I don\u2019t love us any less for our faults though. We both tried to tell one another how we felt in our most unique and coded indirect ways. Our timing just wasn\u2019t right then. The real reason you didn\u2019t hear me sooner was a combination of my lack of confident directness and that you weren\u2019t yet ready. We weren\u2019t yet ready. I want to put salve on those wounds. I want to talk to you about each thing in that cave. We will have to walk through that cave together. It\u2019s important that I hear you and know where and why you hurt. I only hope it will feel better when you know you\u2019ve been heard and seen and that I love you, not in spite of it all, but because of who you are. Thank you for telling me that our past is full of sore spots. Let me hold your hand when we walk through them. Today is not the day, but we will walk through them together. Whatever we find in there  we will be okay as long as we keep talking about it, as long as we keep feeling it, even if it feels sad or upsetting. You can tell me the things. Tell me He is awful and how mad He makes you, it\u2019s okay now. Honestly, it was okay back then. I\u2019m not sure I would have known what to do with it, but it would have been okay. Tell me how She made you mad, how she was a barrier, I don\u2019t know what\u2019s in there but you can tell it to me. Show me which gnats are mine, I know I have gnats to eat. Sending you John O\u2019Donahue is my gnat to eat, for sure.  Tell me how you\u2019re mad at yourself. Tell me all the things. I\u2019ve always told you that you can tell me anything. I meant it. Just please, if you want to tell me you\u2019re gay, it\u2019s a little late, I\u2019ll be very disappointed. I wish you were here so I could come wrap my legs around your waist, and pull you against me and wrap you in my arms so you\u2019re just one wrapped up human, my human.",

No. I don\u2019t love us any less for our faults though. We both tried to tell one another how we felt in our most unique and coded indirect ways. Our timing just wasn\u2019t right then. The real reason you didn\u2019t hear me sooner was a combination of my lack of confident directness and that you weren\u2019t yet ready. We weren\u2019t yet ready. I want to put salve on those wounds. I want to talk to you about each thing in that cave. We will have to walk through that cave together. It\u2019s important that I hear you and know where and why you hurt. I only hope it will feel better when you know you\u2019ve been heard and seen and that I love you, not in spite of it all, but because of who you are. Thank you for telling me that our past is full of sore spots. Let me hold your hand when we walk through them. Today is not the day, but we will walk through them together. Whatever we find in there  we will be okay as long as we keep talking about it, as long as we keep feeling it, even if it feels sad or upsetting. You can tell me the things. Tell me He is awful and how mad He makes you, it\u2019s okay now. Honestly, it was okay back then. I\u2019m not sure I would have known what to do with it, but it would have been okay. Tell me how She made you mad, how she was a barrier, I don\u2019t know what\u2019s in there but you can tell it to me. Show me which gnats are mine, I know I have gnats to eat. Sending you John O\u2019Donahue is my gnat to eat, for sure.  Tell me how you\u2019re mad at yourself. Tell me all the things. I\u2019ve always told you that you can tell me anything. I meant it. Just please, if you want to tell me you\u2019re gay, it\u2019s a little late, I\u2019ll be very disappointed.

I look back so often because it\u2019s there where I find the truth of us. It\u2019s there where our seeds were planted. Did we do this the easy way? No. I don\u2019t love us any less for our faults though. We both tried to tell one another how we felt in our most unique and coded indirect ways. Our timing just wasn\u2019t right then. The real reason you didn\u2019t hear me sooner was a combination of my lack of confident directness and that you weren\u2019t yet ready. We weren\u2019t yet ready. I want to put salve on those wounds. I want to talk to you about each thing in that cave. We will have to walk through that cave together. It\u2019s important that I hear you and know where and why you hurt. I only hope it will feel better when you know you\u2019ve been heard and seen and that I love you, not in spite of it all, but because of who you are. Thank you for telling me that our past is full of sore spots. Let me hold your hand when we walk through them. Today is not the day, but we will walk through them together. Whatever we find in there  we will be okay as long as we keep talking about it, as long as we keep feeling it, even if it feels sad or upsetting. You can tell me the things. Tell me He is awful and how mad He makes you, it\u2019s okay now. Honestly, it was okay back then. I\u2019m not sure I would have known what to do with it, but it would have been okay. Tell me how She made you mad, how she was a barrier, I don\u2019t know what\u2019s in there but you can tell it to me. Show me which gnats are mine, I know I have gnats to eat. Sending you John O\u2019Donahue is my gnat to eat, for sure.  Tell me how you\u2019re mad at yourself. Tell me all the things. I\u2019ve always told you that you can tell me anything. I meant it. Just please, if you want to tell me you\u2019re gay, it\u2019s a little late, I\u2019ll be very disappointed.

No. I don\u2019t love us any less for our faults though. We both tried to tell one another how we felt in our most unique and coded indirect ways. Our timing just wasn\u2019t right then. The real reason you didn\u2019t hear me sooner was a combination of my lack of confident directness and that you weren\u2019t yet ready. We weren\u2019t yet ready. I want to put salve on those wounds. I want to talk to you about each thing in that cave. We will have to walk through that cave together. It\u2019s important that I hear you and know where and why you hurt. I only hope it will feel better when you know you\u2019ve been heard and seen and that I love you, not in spite of it all, but because of who you are. Thank you for telling me that our past is full of sore spots. Let me hold your hand when we walk through them. Today is not the day, but we will walk through them together. Whatever we find in there  we will be okay as long as we keep talking about it, as long as we keep feeling it, even if it feels sad or upsetting. You can tell me the things. Tell me He is awful and how mad He makes you, it\u2019s okay now. Honestly, it was okay back then. I\u2019m not sure I would have known what to do with it, but it would have been okay. Tell me how She made you mad, how she was a barrier, I don\u2019t know what\u2019s in there but you can tell it to me. Show me which gnats are mine, I know I have gnats to eat. Sending you John O\u2019Donahue is my gnat to eat, for sure.  Tell me how you\u2019re mad at yourself. Tell me all the things. I\u2019ve always told you that you can tell me anything. I meant it. Just please, if you want to tell me you\u2019re gay, it\u2019s a little late, I\u2019ll be very disappointed.

I look back so often because it\u2019s there where I find the truth of us. It\u2019s there where our seeds were planted. Did we do this the easy way? No. I don\u2019t love us any less for our faults though. We both tried to tell one another how we felt in our most unique and coded indirect ways. Our timing just wasn\u2019t right then. The real reason you didn\u2019t hear me sooner was a combination of my lack of confident directness and that you weren\u2019t yet ready. We weren\u2019t yet ready. I want to put salve on those wounds. I want to talk to you about each thing in that cave. We will have to walk through that cave together. It\u2019s important that I hear you and know where and why you hurt. I only hope it will feel better when you know you\u2019ve been heard and seen and that I love you, not in spite of it all, but because of who you are. Thank you for telling me that our past is full of sore spots. Let me hold your hand when we walk through them. Today is not the day, but we will walk through them together. Whatever we find in there  we will be okay as long as we keep talking about it, as long as we keep feeling it, even if it feels sad or upsetting. You can tell me the things. Tell me He is awful and how mad He makes you, it\u2019s okay now. Honestly, it was okay back then. I\u2019m not sure I would have known what to do with it, but it would have been okay. Tell me how She made you mad, how she was a barrier, I don\u2019t know what\u2019s in there but you can tell it to me. Show me which gnats are mine, I know I have gnats to eat. Sending you John O\u2019Donahue is my gnat to eat, for sure.  Tell me how you\u2019re mad at yourself. Tell me all the things. I\u2019ve always told you that you can tell me anything. I meant it. Just please, if you want to tell me you\u2019re gay, it\u2019s a little late, I\u2019ll be very disappointed.
